"3SP5P697","journalArticle","2024","Cabano, Frank Gregory; Li, Mengge; Jiménez, Fernando R","Consumer responses to CEO activism: an impression management approach","European Journal of Marketing","","03090566","10.1108/EJM-07-2022-0553","https://www.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/consumer-responses-ceo-activism-impression/docview/3072148740/se-2?accountid=12006","PurposeThis paper aims to examine how and why consumers respond to chief executive officer (CEO) activism on social media. The authors developed a conceptual model that proposes impression management as a mechanism for consumer response to CEO activism.Design/methodology/approachIn Study 1a, the authors examined 83,259 tweets from 90 CEOs and compared consumer responses between controversial and noncontroversial tweets. In Study 1b, the authors replicated the analysis, using a machine-learning topic modeling approach. In Studies 2 and 3, the authors used experimental designs to test the theoretical mechanism.FindingsOn average, consumers tend to respond more to CEO posts dealing with noncontroversial issues. Consumers’ relative reluctance to like and share controversial posts is motivated by fear of rejection. However, CEO fame reverses this effect. Consumers are more likely to engage in controversial activist threads by popular CEOs. This effect holds for consumers high (vs low) in public self-consciousness. CEO fame serves as a “shield” behind which consumers protect their online image.Research limitations/implicationsThe study focused on Twitter (aka “X”) in the USA. Future research may replicate the study in other social media platforms and countries. The authors introduce “shielding” – liking and sharing content authored by a recognizable source – as a tactic for impression management on social media.Practical implicationsFamous CEOs should speak up about controversial issues on social media because their voice helps consumers engage more in such conversations.Originality/valueThis paper offers a theoretical framework to understand consumer reactions to CEO activism.","2024","2025-02-07 22:27:26","2025-02-07 22:27:26","","1275-1297","","5","58","","","","","","","","","","English","","","ABI/INFORM Collection; ProQuest One Psychology","3072148740","","","Number: 5 Place: Bradford Publisher: Emerald Group Publishing Limited","","","https://libkey.io/libraries/3027/openurl?ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&ctx_enc=info:ofi/enc:UTF-8&rfr_id=info:sid/ProQuest&rft_val_fmt=journal&rft.genre=article&rft.jtitle=European+Journal+of+Marketing&rft.atitle=Consumer+responses+to+CEO+activism%3A+an+impression+management+approach&rft.au=Cabano%2C+Frank+Gregory%3BLi%2C+Mengge%3BJim%C3%A9nez%2C+Fernando+R.&rft.aulast=Cabano&rft.aufirst=Frank&rft.date=2024-05-01&rft.volume=58&rft.issue=5&rft.spage=1275&rft.isbn=&rft.btitle=&rft.title=European+Journal+of+Marketing&rft.issn=03090566&rft_id=info:doi/10.1108%2FEJM-07-2022-0553","Abortion; Activists; Business And Economics--Marketing And Purchasing; CEO activism; Chief executive officers; Consumers; Employees; Experimental design; Impression management; Management theory; Political activism; Quantitative research; Shielding; Social activism; Social media; Social networks; Twitter","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Commentators have tried to fit this development into familiar frameworks of shareholder value or management entrenchment. In contrast, in this Article we develop, for the first time, a theory of ESG as a product of social demand. Our framework shows that increasing demand for socially responsible corporate behavior, originating in but not limited to the millennial generation, has created powerful incentives for corporate managers to promote ESG goals. We identify and analyze five specific channels of social demand that pressure CEOs to promote ESG. First, markets-consumers, employees, and investors-may reward firms for promoting ESG. Second, and more important, risk averse CEOs may rationally invest corporate money to minimize personal risk from boycotts and walkouts. Third, large index fund managers have responded to social demand by embracing ESG activism to lure investors. Fourth, activist hedge funds target firms with ESG vulnerabilities, to later leverage them in their fight for board seats. Fifth, social demand could facilitate ESG regulation by pressuring firms to reduce lobbying activities that are not aligned with ESG goals and by tilting regulatory cost-benefit analyses in favor of ESG rules. As a result, we argue, CEOs face overwhelming, perhaps excessive, pressure to deliver on ESG goals or face career-limiting consequences. Our framework has important implications for the ESG and stakeholderism debates, for the future and desirability of ESG, and for corporate and securities law.","2023","2025-02-07 22:27:26","2025-02-07 22:27:26","","255-306","","2","28","","","","","","","","","","English","","","ABI/INFORM Collection","2865596216","","","Number: 2 Place: Stanford Publisher: Stanford University, Stanford Law School","","; ","https://media.proquest.com/media/hms/PFT/1/Nd7HV?_a=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&_s=GmYsnrVg4VxVHsluA0%2BvtAwGNsA%3D; https://libkey.io/libraries/3027/openurl?ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&ctx_enc=info:ofi/enc:UTF-8&rfr_id=info:sid/ProQuest&rft_val_fmt=journal&rft.genre=article&rft.jtitle=Stanford+Journal+of+Law%2C+Business+%26+Finance&rft.atitle=The+Millennial+Corporation%3A+Strong+Stakeholders%2C+Weak+Managers&rft.au=Barzuza%2C+Michal%3BCurtis%2C+Quinn%3BWebber%2C+David+H.&rft.aulast=Barzuza&rft.aufirst=Michal&rft.date=2023-04-01&rft.volume=28&rft.issue=2&rft.spage=255&rft.isbn=&rft.btitle=&rft.title=Stanford+Journal+of+Law%2C+Business+%26+Finance&rft.issn=10788794&rft_id=info:doi/","52394:Portfolio Management and Investment Advice; 52591:Open-End Investment Funds; Activism; Activists; Biophysical environment; Business And Economics--Banking And Finance; Careers; Climate change; Corporate governance; Cost benefit analysis; Directors; Economic; Employees; Hedge funds; Index funds; Investment advisors; Investors; Labor disputes; Lobbying; Management; Millennials; Regulation; Shareholder voting; Social; Social goals; Social networks; Stockholders","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In consequence, 1,146 lead themes were derived and studied in an in-depth qualitative analysis by deploying a pattern-inducing method.Findings>Research on CEO activism can be placed on a time-oriented logic, giving insights into the realisation of activism, stakeholder reactions, moderators and perception effects. These four aggregate dimensions can be explained by 15 second-order themes and 48 more detailed first-order themes.Practical implications>Considering the risks and benefits of CEO activism, top executives and communication professionals should be aware of its implications. This paper provides an integrated view of the different mechanisms and potential effects of CEO activism. Thereby, it proposes communicative planning from activism’s realisation to its perceptual results.Originality/value>The study provides a holistic view of CEO activism as a starting point for further discussion.

In considering the events that led some of the most well-known CEOs in the United States to step away from the Presidential table, the author reviewed the literature in regard to corporate activism and sought to determine whether speaking out or remaining silent had a financial impact on stock price.

Facing a Senate filibuster, its proponents weakened the proposal—making it, according to historian Jefferson Cowie, ""lean, moderate, and basically unchallenging to the corporate order.""1 Even in its attenuated state, however, the bill would have curbed the most flagrant violations of private-sector workers' rights. Though this version reached the precipice of the supermajority necessary to invoke cloture, it ultimately fell two votes short.This article seeks to understand how antiunion activists defeated organized labor's last big legislative opportunity to reverse its fortunes in the wake of deindustrialization and an onslaught of corporate attacks in the 1970s. Indeed, the right's success in stymieing labor reform was decidedly momentous, especially because the law represented such a modest change. Kim Phillips-Fein has shown that a half a century of activism from market fundamentalist intellectuals and anti–New Deal businessmen paved the way for the formation of the Business Roundtable—a group of powerful CEO's from Fortune 500 companies—and politicized other somnolent forces like the [End Page 378] Chamber of Commerce. In fact, she shows that by the 1970s there was a robust, consciously political ""business activist movement.""2 Kim Moody's account of the failure of the bill—as ""labor's major agenda point of the decade""—centers on the pushback from anti-labor corporate activism, in particular the Roundtable.","2017-07","2025-02-07 22:27:26","2025-02-07 22:27:26","","378-402","","3","29","","","","","","","","","","English","","","PAIS Index; Worldwide Political Science Abstracts","1911518810","","","Number: 3 Place: Cambridge Publisher: Cambridge University Press","","","https://libkey.io/libraries/3027/openurl?ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&ctx_enc=info:ofi/enc:UTF-8&rfr_id=info:sid/ProQuest&rft_val_fmt=journal&rft.genre=article&rft.jtitle=Journal+of+Policy+History+%3A+JPH&rft.atitle=%26quot%3BCompulsory+Unionism%26quot%3B+and+Its+Critics%3A+The+National+Right+to+Work+Committee%2C+Teacher+Unions%2C+and+the+Defeat+of+Labor+Law+Reform+in+1978&rft.au=Shelton%2C+Jon.&rft.aulast=Shelton&rft.aufirst=Jon&rft.date=2017-07-01&rft.volume=29&rft.issue=3&rft.spage=378&rft.isbn=&rft.btitle=&rft.title=Journal+of+Policy+History+%3A+JPH&rft.issn=08980306&rft_id=info:doi/10.1017%2FS0898030617000161","9001:history and theory; 9021:academic discipline; 9141:political economy; 9161:politics and law; Black Power movement; Collective bargaining; Contract negotiations; Deindustrialization; Employees; Employers; Employment policies; Filibusters; Labor law; Labor relations; Labor unions; Labour law; Legal reform; Local elections; political economy; political history/historiography; Political parties; Political representation; Political Science; politics and law; professional issues (teaching, academic careers); Right to work; State elections; Unionization; Wagner Act 1935-US; Workers; Workers' rights","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We theorize that the personal values of the firm's elite decision makers constitute a key element of this corporate opportunity structure. We specifically consider the political ideology -- conservatism versus liberalism -- of the company's CEO as a signal for employees who are considering the merits of engaging in activism. To test of our theory, we examine the formation of lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender employee groups in major companies in the period 1985-2004, when the formation of such groups was generally perceived to be risky for participants. Using CEOs' records of political donations to measure their personal ideologies, we find strong evidence that the political liberalism of CEOs influences the likelihood of activism. We also find that CEOs' ideologies influence activism more strongly when CEOs are more powerful, when they oversee more conservative (i.e., less liberal) workplaces, and when the social movement is in the early phase of development. We identify theoretical and practical implications, as well as future research opportunities.","2014-12","2025-02-07 22:27:26","2025-02-07 22:27:26","","1786-1809","","6","57","","","","","","","","","","English","","","International Bibliography of the Social Sciences (IBSS)","1650533903; 4641345","","","Number: 6","","","https://libkey.io/libraries/3027/openurl?ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&ctx_enc=info:ofi/enc:UTF-8&rfr_id=info:sid/ProQuest&rft_val_fmt=journal&rft.genre=article&rft.jtitle=Academy+of+Management+journal&rft.atitle=CEO+ideology+as+an+element+of+the+corporate+opportunity+structure+for+social+activists&rft.au=Briscoe%2C+Forrest%3BChin%2C+M+K%3BHambrick%2C+Donald+C.&rft.aulast=Briscoe&rft.aufirst=Forrest&rft.date=2014-12-01&rft.volume=57&rft.issue=6&rft.spage=1786&rft.isbn=&rft.btitle=&rft.title=Academy+of+Management+journal&rft.issn=00014273&rft_id=info:doi/","Activism; Bisexuality; Chief executive officers; Conservatives; Economics; Employees; Lesbianism; Organizational behaviour; Probability; Work place","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this article, we examine how the globalization of national business systems has influenced the framing of corporate social responsibility (CSR). This is done using text analysis of CEO letters appearing in the annual reports of 15 major corporations in Sweden during a period of transformational change. The results show that the discourse about CSR in the annual reports has changed from a national and communitarian view of social responsibility (cf. a negotiated view of CSR) toward an international and individualistic view of social responsibility (cf. a self-regulating view of CSR). The article contributes theoretically (1) by adding a national-global dimension to previous conceptualizations of CSR and (2) by showing that the rise of CSR discourse and activities in the last 10 years does not have to imply an increased commitment and interest in corporate responsibility per se, only that there are increased societal expectations that corporations should develop the capability to act more independently as moral agents.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]","2010-06","2025-02-07 22:27:26","2025-02-07 22:27:26","","653-669","","4","93","","","","","","","","","","English","","","ABI/INFORM Collection; International Bibliography of the Social Sciences (IBSS); PAIS Index; ProQuest One Psychology","198026181","","","Number: 4 Place: Dordrecht Publisher: Springer Nature B.V.","","; ","https://media.proquest.com/media/hms/OBJ/iCAsT?_a=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%3D%3D&_s=ySdxYqRFA0bMRyO6d9x%2Fk%2Fh8FoE%3D; https://libkey.io/libraries/3027/openurl?ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&ctx_enc=info:ofi/enc:UTF-8&rfr_id=info:sid/ProQuest&rft_val_fmt=journal&rft.genre=article&rft.jtitle=Journal+of+Business+Ethics&rft.atitle=The+Framing+of+Corporate+Social+Responsibility+and+the+Globalization+of+National+Business+Systems%3A+A+Longitudinal+Case+Study%3A+JBE&rft.au=Tengblad%2C+Stefan%3BOhlsson%2C+Claes.&rft.aulast=Tengblad&rft.aufirst=Stefan&rft.date=2010-06-01&rft.volume=93&rft.issue=4&rft.spage=653&rft.isbn=&rft.btitle=&rft.title=Journal+of+Business+Ethics&rft.issn=01674544&rft_id=info:doi/10.1007%2Fs10551-009-0246-2","Annual reports; Business; Business ethics; Capital markets; Capitalism; Case studies; Case study; Content analysis; Corporate responsibility; Corporate social responsibility; Framing; Globalization; Human rights; Law; Longitudinal studies; Political activism; Qualitative research; Social responsibility; Standardization; Text analysis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Monckton notes that a new UN report will estimate the greenhouse effect of carbon dioxide at little more than 1% of the natural greenhouse effect & the sea-level rise by 2100 at just 17 inches. Nor is there any evidence that global warming causes more or stronger hurricanes. The devastation of New Orleans by Katrina was due more to the irresponsible lack of human preparation than to the hurricane itself. The only thing on which there is consensus is that there is more carbon dioxide in the air today than a century ago, that humankind may be blamed for the increase, & that some warming may result. How much warming over what period of time & with what effect are questions that cannot be answered at present.

In Asia it is increasingly being managed strategically at the highest corporate levels. A survey of C-suite executives in Asia, North America and Europe by Hill & Knowlton and Korn/Ferry International finds, however, that Asian executives are more focused on using corporate reputation to drive tangible business benefit than their North American and European peers. Corporate social responsibility and the broader range of stakeholders beyond customers and shareholders does not feature strongly in the corporate reputation agenda of Asian executives. The survey results indicate Asian executives are more concerned with core stakeholders, such as customers and shareholders, and bottom-line performance and corporate governance rather than softer areas of reputation management, such as community relations and internal communications. The time has come for Asian CEOs to take a broader perspective to corporate reputation management.

They are the key driver in the public's increasing demand that corporations act in a socially responsible way. This means not only offering products and services that do not pose new environmental or social risks but also doing business in a way that supports the livelihood of people in the producing nations and sustainability of our planet's ecosystems. NGOs are powerful with consumers because they are significantly more trusted overall than business. CEOs and corporate managers may approve or disapprove of the growing role of activist NGOs, but it is perilous to ignore their growing influence and ability to shape public perceptions of a company. There are seven guiding principles for successfully engaging the NGOs: (1) act and respond as one global brand, making certain that, for example, the environmental practices by a unit in Spain are consistent with the corporate position in the USA; (2) prepare for greater transparency, reporting social and environmental impacts as well as financial information is a starting point for building greater trust and dialogue with the NGOs; (3) do not be forced into a ""yes-or-no"" public confrontation on any issue; (4) enlist and engage multiple partners and perspectives on business practices and strategies; (5) do not rely solely on industrywide action, or hide behind it; (6) distinguish between an NGO's rhetoric and its actual objectives; and (7) know when to stand your ground.

At a minimum, CEOs are now spokespersons on public policy issues that are relevant to the company.  In some cases, CEOs have become political activists on those issues and become more directly involved in the political process.  Three forces are working today affecting the future role of public relations practitioners: 1.  identification and following of issues in corporate staffs prior to legislation, 2.  development of corporate policies and communicating those policies to change or block restrictive legislation, and 3.  the emergence of CEOs as spokespersons for the company and the assumption by the CEO of a direct involvement in issues of public policy.  Decisions on public policy issues are the responsibility of the CEO, and are usually made based on recommendations from the public relations or public affairs advisor.  Legal departments are often asked for advice also.  Many companies have established public issues committees, cutting across several department lines.  Indications are that CEOs are more reluctant to use outside public relations agencies for these new functions.","1982","2025-02-07 22:27:26","2025-02-07 22:27:26","","19","","2","27","","","","","","","","","","English","","","ABI/INFORM Collection","222489044; 00182845","","","Number: 2 Place: Rhinebeck Publisher: Public Relations Quarterly","","","https://libkey.io/libraries/3027/openurl?ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&ctx_enc=info:ofi/enc:UTF-8&rfr_id=info:sid/ProQuest&rft_val_fmt=journal&rft.genre=article&rft.jtitle=Public+Relations+Quarterly&rft.atitle=Communicating+on+Public+Issues%3A+A+Changing+Role+for+the+CEO&rft.au=Fox%2C+James+F.&rft.aulast=Fox&rft.aufirst=James&rft.date=1982-07-01&rft.volume=27&rft.issue=2&rft.spage=19&rft.isbn=&rft.btitle=&rft.title=Public+Relations+Quarterly&rft.issn=00333700&rft_id=info:doi/","2120:Chief executive officers; 2400:Public relations; 54182:Public Relations Agencies; Activism; Advertising And Public Relations; Chief executive officer; Chief executive officers; Polls & surveys; Public policy; Public relations; Public relations agencies; Responsibilities; Roles","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We use two experiments to examine how CEO (in)activism impacts investor decisions. Our results are consistent with our theoretical predictions. When a CEO expresses an activist position that is consistent versus inconsistent with investors' views, investors invest more in the CEO's firm because they perceive the CEO more positively. We also find that CEO inactivism can lead to investment decisions that are as favorable as when the CEO expresses a position consistent with investors' views; our process evidence suggests that this may occur because CEO inactivism increases the likelihood that investors believe the CEO shares their position on a social issue. Finally, we do not find evidence that investor decisions are influenced by whether CEO (in)activism is in response to an external prompt. This study contributes to the emerging literature on CEO activism, a unique form of voluntary disclosure, by providing evidence about how CEO (in)activism influences investors.

The paper argues that associations such as the BCA confront a range of serious institutional problems in their attempts to wield political power, or more modestly perhaps, policy influence. First, they confront a disconnect between ?structural? and ?instrumentalist? articulations of business power. The key source of business power resides in business control over the economy and the investment process, a form of power wielded at the company level not at the level of business associations. When engaged in instrumentalist or overt forms of political activism, the BCA also confronts serious collective action problems. It is also argued that the influence of the BCA seems to have declined over time and that this can partly be traced back to declining CEO commitment rooted in changing institutional and structural dynamics in the corporate world.

Simultaneously, the general public is increasingly politically polarized. We examine how CEOs' support for gun control after two mass shootings differentially affected the behavior of liberal and conservative consumers and the persistence of these effects. Using mobile phone location data to measure store-level visits, we find (a) consumer visits to stores decreased by 3%; (b) this decrease was asymmetric: visits in the most conservative counties decreased by about 5% but did not change in the most liberal counties; and (c) these effects dissipated within 10 weeks after activism. Our results highlight the strategic implications for executives pressured to take stances on controversial issues. Managerial Summary: We study how consumers respond to CEO support for gun control, and how consumers' partisan views influence their behavior. Visits to the stores of several major retailers declined about 3% in the 4 weeks after their CEOs supported expanding background checks for gun purchases. In the most liberal counties, visits did not change following CEO support for gun control, while in the most conservative counties visits declined about 5%. Hence, the reaction of liberal consumers did not counteract the reaction of conservative consumers. We find, however, that these effects dissipated within 10 weeks; as a result, retailers whose CEOs supported gun control did not experience any long-term, net decrease in sales despite the short-term sales decrease in conservative counties. © 2022 The Authors.

In our model consumers care about the type of firm they buy from, but also understand that corporate leaders can make false or misleading statements to pander to valuable demographics. We show that, although the profitability of CEO activism is severely compromised by this wokewashing, under some conditions credible, value-enhancing sociopolitical communications can still take place. We characterize (i) when corporate leaders prefer to stay silent; (ii) when wokewashing is so widespread that no credible communication is possible; and (iii) when instead some credible communication can take place. We also show how an intrinsically motivated CEO can destroy or increase firm value. Managerial Summary: Many corporate leaders take public stances on sociopolitical issues and observers suggest that this practice can sometimes create firm value. A problem with the idea, however, is that, if taking a certain stance is indeed value enhancing, then many other CEOs may be tempted to take the same stance opportunistically. In this article, we study how CEO activism can be profitable when wokewashing is a real concern. We show that credible, value-enhancing sociopolitical communications require controversial messages, as significant opposition from consumers with different worldviews is necessary to ensure the credibility of communications. Far from being a “bug,” controversy is a feature of credible CEO activism. We also demonstrate that a CEO's intrinsic motivation to take a stand can sometimes create value by making communications more credible. Obliquely, then, a CEO not primarily motivated by profits may be the best at maximizing profits. © 2023 The Authors.

Yet, CEOs are increasingly choosing sides in societal debates despite the inherent risk of alienating stakeholders who disagree with the CEO’s stance. Even more puzzlingly, conservative CEOs sometimes espouse liberal stances in such debates, which runs counter to the otherwise consistent evidence in the upper echelons literature that CEOs are guided by their own values in their actions. Our study addresses this paradox by examining the antecedents of CEO liberal activism, with an emphasis on the interplay between the CEO’s ideology and the prevailing ideological tilt of the employee population in driving CEOs’ activism decisions. Drawing on the concept of managerial discretion, or latitude of action, we theorize that a pronounced organizational ideology constrains a CEO’s ability to act in accordance with their own values—particularly in the highly symbolic domain of activism. We also argue that conservative CEOs are relatively more focused on instrumental rationales for activism, whereas liberal CEOs tend to prioritize more intrinsic rationales, a consequence of which is that conservative CEOs more heavily weight organizational ideology in their activism decisions. We test our theory in the context of a highly publicized letter signed by nearly 100 CEOs of public companies in opposition to North Carolina’s controversial 2016 “bathroom bill.” Relying on a variety of novel data sources, we find robust support for our theory. © 2024 INFORMS.","2024","2025-02-07 22:27:55","2025-02-07 22:27:55","","1388 – 1408","","4","35","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Number: 4 Type: Article","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

These competing expectations have created a scenario where engaging, not engaging, or incorrectly engaging in CEO activism all carry the risk of alienating at least some stakeholders and undermining CEO and firm reputation and performance. Further, extant research has primarily focused on whether CEOs engage in activism rather than disentangling the heterogeneous ways by which they do so. We address these shortcomings and augment existing theory by comprehensively considering distinct CEO activism engagement strategies, their outcomes, and the moderators influencing relations between the two. Moreover, we illuminate the highly heterogeneous nature of CEO activism to better capture the phenomenon’s complexity. We first introduce the CEO Activism Decision Matrix—a typology of four unique activism engagement strategies based on the behavioral dimensions of CEO Talk (leveraging communicative power) and CEO Action (leveraging economic power), successfully addressing the heterogeneity in activism behaviors that existing theory has overlooked. We then present an integrative conceptual model that outlines the short- and long-term consequences and relevant moderators of CEO activism engagement and offer detailed recommendations for future research, including methodological guidance on operationalizing variables and designing research that can infer causality. Altogether, we demonstrate that although CEOs may find themselves “damned if you do, and damned if you don’t” engage in activism, they also have the potential to drive meaningful career, firm, and societal change based on how they choose to engage. © The Author(s) 2024.","2024","2025-02-07 22:27:55","2025-02-07 22:27:55","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

On average, showing a CEO message supporting abortion rights is not more effective at mobilizing pro-choice citizens than showing no message or showing a message from other speakers. Additionally, CEOs do not provoke countermobilization by people who oppose abortion. We explore heterogeneous treatment effects and find that CEO activism is better at motivating pro-choice citizens to engage in politics when their senators are Democrats and thus likely receptive to pro-choice activism, consistent with stakeholder alignment theory.

We address this relatively unexplored but important phenomenon by developing a theory of CEO sociopolitical activism. Our stakeholder alignment model posits that CEO activism stems foremost from a CEO’s personal values but is facilitated (or suppressed) by the CEO’s expectation of support from stakeholders, particularly employees and customers. We also highlight the importance of CEO power, celebrity, and narcissism in influencing whether, and how vividly, the CEO’s values manifest in activism. Then, following an episode of CEO activism, stakeholders psychologically respond to the leader’s action. Those who were ex ante predisposed toward the CEO’s public stance will feel pride in their affiliation with the company, and will consequently experience heightened identification with the firm and with the CEO’s stance. Stakeholders who were ex ante averse to the CEO’s stance will experience diminished identification with the firm, and their oppositional stance will be further cemented. Finally, we juxtapose CEO activism with other society-oriented firm practices (e.g., corporate social responsibility and corporate lobbying) and develop propositions about their independent and joint effects on stakeholder identification. © Academy of Management Review","2021","2025-02-07 22:27:55","2025-02-07 22:27:55","","33 – 59","","1","46","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Number: 1 Type: Article","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We choose this setting since activism is likely to have a stronger impact when a CEO is politically connected. However, by engaging in advocacy, a CEO risks severing the very same political links that underlie the strength of the message. We find that shareholders react negatively to the decision to quit a presidential advisory council, which is consistent with a fear of weakening their firm's political influence. The decision to publicly advocate seems to be driven more by a CEO's personal political ideology than by a company's general involvement in corporate social responsibility.

Research on this practice has been primarily concerned with determining the conditions under which a CEO’s public statements on sociopolitical issues are beneficial or detrimental to her firm’s business performance. We complement this instrumental perspective on CEO activism with an ethical investigation of the implications of CEO activism for the democratic process. Drawing on political philosophy, we show that the answer to the question of whether CEO activism is conducive to the democratic process depends on the view of democracy that is adopted. From the perspective of liberalism, the sole requirement that an instance of CEO activism must fulfill is that it is lawful, provided that the applicable law sufficiently protects people’s essential rights. However, from the viewpoint of republicanism, this is not a sufficient condition. Besides being law-abiding, CEOs should be “civic-minded” when intervening in public debates, i.e., concerned with the quality and fairness with which those debates are conducted. Based on the literature on republicanism, we suggest four possible criteria that civic-minded CEOs can apply to gauge the democratic conduciveness of a possible public intervention: added insight, timeliness, constructiveness, and transparency. Our article complements the predominantly instrumentally oriented literature on CEO activism and contributes, more broadly, to the literature that explores the normative dimensions of corporate political involvement, as well as to a growing strand of research that draws on philosophical theory to inform business leaders’ ethical decision-making. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. 2023.","2024","2025-02-07 22:27:55","2025-02-07 22:27:55","","755 – 774","","4","190","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Number: 4 Type: Article","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Thus, future research could explore the extent to which the findings generalize to other contexts. Practical implications: Results provide insights to top managers who communicate with various stakeholders on emotionally charged social issues. Findings also offer insights on the timing of trades for investors and arbitrageurs. Social implications: Findings contribute to the understanding of corporate behaviour in times of social upheaval. Insights from the study may also be used to inform corporate communication decisions about important social issues. Originality/value: This study brings into focus the role that affective appeal and moral emotion can play in evoking motivation for corporate activism, and the impact that this has on investor opinions’ formation process. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","2022","2025-02-07 22:27:55","2025-02-07 22:27:55","","236 – 256","","2","17","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Number: 2 Type: Article","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

All sources are cited in the case narrative and as end notes. Case overview/synopsis: In April 2022, The Walt Disney Company and its CEO, Robert Chapek, were at the center of a controversy over the company’s opposition to the State of Florida’s Parental Rights in Education bill. The bill, dubbed “Don’t Say Gay” by its critics, prohibited instruction on sexual identity and gender orientation in the state’s elementary schools. The controversy stemmed from Disney’s initial non-reaction to the bill and its later strident opposition and call for its repeal. Chapek was pressured by negative media publicity and employee disgruntlement on the one hand and adverse economic consequences for opposing the bill by the state’s Governor, Ron DeSantis. Chapek and the Board had to respond to the political threats to Disney’s economic well-being while appeasing its employees and other stakeholders who wanted the company to be a corporate champion in diversity, equity and inclusion. Complexity academic level: The case is best suited for advanced undergraduate or graduate leadership, strategic management and marketing courses. From a leadership and strategic management perspective, the case is well-suited for demonstrating the evolving expectations of leaders and corporate social responsibility, as well as the concepts of issue framing and nonmarket management. Instructors may also leverage the case in marketing courses (e.g. brand management), as CEO activism (i.e. messaging and practice) is one characteristic of brand activism (Animation Guild, 2022). © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.","2024","2025-02-07 22:27:55","2025-02-07 22:27:55","","698 – 719","","3","20","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Number: 3 Type: Article","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Yet more and more CEOs are taking visible public stands on hotly contested issues, engaging in what has come to be called CEO sociopolitical activism. Despite its growing prevalence and potentially major implications, this class of executive behaviors remains largely unexplored by organizational scholars. Our study tests and elaborates on stakeholder alignment theory to investigate the influence of CEO activism on employees’ attitudes and behaviors, particularly its effects on employees’ organizational commitment and support for the ideology underpinning the CEO’s public stance. Our theoretical predictions hinge on the degree of alignment between the CEO’s stance and the prevailing ideological tilt of the employee population, as well as the degree to which employees view the CEO as a credible leader. We test our ideas in the context of a highly publicized letter signed by nearly 100 public company CEOs in opposition to North Carolina’s controversial 2016 “bathroom bill.” Relying on multiple data sources to examine differences between firms whose CEOs signed the letter and firms whose CEOs declined the invitation to sign, we find general support for our theory, indicating that CEO activism has important intra- and extra-firm implications. © The Author(s) 2022.","2022","2025-02-07 22:27:55","2025-02-07 22:27:55","","553 – 593","","2","67","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Number: 2 Type: Article","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Leaders across industries have addressed the expectation by engaging in activism. While some upper echelons leaders initiate activism efforts in a way that strengthens their firms, others are struggling to do so without risking brand and business performance. This research addresses this important managerial challenge by conceptualizing activism through a risk paradigm. To do this, we first introduce and define a construct called Enterprise Activism. The construct comprises all forms of firm-initiated activism which can impact brand and business performance, such as brand activism, CEO activism, and corporate activism, regardless of who is making the decision (e.g., Chief Marketing Officer or store manager) or whether a portfolio brand or the corporate brand is involved (e.g., Harris Teeter or the corporate brand, Kroger). We then conceptualize the Enterprise Activism Risk Model, providing insight into how different types of actions can pose market share and positional advantage risks. Leveraging insight from C-level leaders, we identify ways that firm leaders can deploy the model to advance business practice. Finally, we provide a research agenda to develop new theory and evidence to help support and improve practice. The new insight provided herein provides a framework that can enable upper echelons leaders to evaluate, discuss, and navigate activism to minimize business risk. © 2024 The Authors","2024","2025-02-07 22:27:55","2025-02-07 22:27:55","","330 – 340","","2","100","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Number: 2 Type: Article","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In particular, it focuses on the ideological alignment between a firm's upper echelons and its general employees. We theorize that participation in progressive corporate activism reflects the ideological views of both the top management team and general employees. By examining firm participation in letter campaigns supporting progressive causes, our findings indicate that ideological alignment between a top management teams and general employees' liberal political leanings is associated with a firm's participation in progressive corporate activism. The CEO's own ideological preferences do not have an independent association with this kind of activism. This article concludes with a discussion of implications for our understanding of corporate political action and nonmarket strategy. Managerial Summary: This article looks at the relationship between political ideology and firm participation in sociopolitical activism. Although some have argued that firms' activism reflects a CEO's ideological preferences or employee activism, we find that neither explanation fully accounts for the kinds of companies that engage in this kind of activism. We find that progressive corporate activism reflects the ideological views of both top management and general employees. Our findings suggest that companies that have ideological alignment on progressive issues are more likely to take public stands on those issues because the stands reinforce core values held by employees and the top management. © 2024 The Author(s).

It holds that corporations should communicate in ways that advocate for racial justice, attempt to improve race relations, and support achieving a more equitable and harmonious society. Corporations have this responsibility to race because they have historically perpetuated and profited from racial oppression, making corporations contributors to, and benefactors of, racial injustice. However, recently corporations have been using their platforms to speak against racial injustice in an effort to improve race relations. CRR theory provides a new way to readily identify, understand, contextualize, theorize and analyze corporate communication about race. Although CRR emerges from a Unites States perspective, and as a public relations concept, it has global applications in any place where racial difference leads to oppression, and it has analytical value in any field where organizational resources can be leveraged to fight oppression. © 2021 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","2021","2025-02-07 22:27:55","2025-02-07 22:27:55","","6 – 22","","1","33","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Number: 1 Type: Article","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Globally, trust is stagnating; in the USA, it has collapsed altogether. The corporate reputation bubble has burst, and with it, people’s trust that organisations will do the right thing. The flipside of these issues is an opportunity for companies to take action to restore trust and enhance reputation. At the top of the list is strong corporate purpose — the new business imperative that is quickly becoming today’s clarion call. Unlike traditional corporate social responsibility, a moral purpose should reflect a company’s DNA, serving as a natural extension of its business, addressing a societal problem like climate change or world hunger. Another area involves a renewed focus on earned media. Society is now looking to experts like trusted journalists as sources of credible information; companies must continue to cultivate relationships with them in order to tell their stories through respected media channels. There is also a new expectation for chief executives, who now must play the role of chief values officer and demonstrate activism for relevant causes to enhance reputation.

It shows how the socio-political context manifested in national and transnational policies, regulations and other socio-political events can influence the CEO talk about sustainability. Design/methodology/approach: This study adopts an interpretative and qualitative method of analysis using the lenses of the theoretical concepts of framing and legitimacy, analysing CEOs’ letters from 10 multinational industrial companies based in Sweden, over the period of 2008–2019. Findings: The results show that various discourses of sustainability, emerging from policies and regulatory initiatives, socio-political events and civil society activism, are reflected in the ways CEOs frame sustainability over time. This article reveals that CEOs not only lead the discourse of profitable sustainability, but they also slowly adapt their sustainability talk to other discourses led by the policymakers, regulators and civil society. This pattern of a slow adaptation is especially visible in a period characterised by increased discourses of climate urgency and regulations related to social and environmental sustainability. Research limitations/implications: The theoretical frame is built by integrating the concepts of legitimacy and framing. Appreciating dynamic notions of legitimacy and framing, the study suggests a novel view of reporting as a film series, presenting many frames of sustainability over time. It helps the study to conceptualise CEO framing of sustainability as adaptive framing. This study suggests using a dynamic notion of adaptive framing in future longitudinal studies of corporate- and accounting communication. Practical implications: The results show that policymakers, regulators and civil society, through their initiatives, influence the CEOs' framing of sustainability. It is thus important for regulators to substantiate sustainability-related discourses and develop conceptual tools and language of social and environmental sustainability that can lead CEO framing more effectively. Originality/value: The study engages with Goffman's notion of dynamic framing. Dynamic framing suggests a novel view of reporting as a film series, presenting many frames of sustainability over time and conceptualises CEO framing of sustainability as adaptive framing. © 2023, Susanne Arivdsson and Svetlana Sabelfeld.","2023","2025-02-07 22:27:55","2025-02-07 22:27:55","","161 – 199","","9","36","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Number: 9 Type: Article","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It introduces a model for selecting activism topics, emphasizing issue maturity and congruence as critical factors. The study investigates how topic selection influences public trust in CEO activism and perceptions of CEO leadership, ultimately impacting public support for the advocated issue and company loyalty. Design/methodology/approach: A randomized 2 × 2 experiment was conducted: issue maturity (mature vs controversial) and issue-company congruence (high vs low). Findings: Generally, CEO activism on mature issues fostered greater public trust and favorable evaluations of transformational leadership compared to controversial issues. However, issue-company congruency significantly moderated these effects. Mature, high-congruence issues led to increased trust, positive leadership evaluations and greater advocacy and company loyalty. In contrast, mature issues with low congruency did not yield the same positive outcomes. Controversial issues with high congruency resulted in the lowest levels of trust, potentially leading to backlash and diminished the positive impact of CEO activism. Originality/value: The results underscore the importance of strategic issue selection for CEO activism. Carefully chosen topics, considering both issue maturity and company-issue congruence, can effectively garner public support for the sociopolitical issue the CEO is advocating for while simultaneously enhancing perceptions of the CEO’s leadership and fostering company loyalty. © 2024, Emerald Publishing Limited.","2024","2025-02-07 22:27:55","2025-02-07 22:27:55","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Positioned as an expression of personal morality, such activism is potentially highly influential because of CEOs’ public visibility and associated positional and resource-based power. This paper questions the assumption that CEO activism can only be explained in relation to individual moral action, and illuminates its wider social implications. We critically evaluate the recent upsurge in CEO activism by juxtaposing it against broader social activism, identifying its distinctive characteristics, and empirically examining two recent ‘moral episodes’: the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program and the Fetal Heartbeat Acts (FHAs). Our analysis demonstrates that CEO activism is more heterogeneous than research to date has shown. Building on this analysis, a refined understanding of the character and morality of CEO activism is developed by establishing a typology of its forms. We conclude that while CEO activism is an important and potent new phenomenon, it may not be universally appropriate to regard CEOs as moral leaders. Instead, it is paramount to question the motives and effects of what CEOs do in the name of morality. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.","2021","2025-02-07 22:27:55","2025-02-07 22:27:55","","269 – 285","","2","170","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Number: 2 Type: Article","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Case overview/synopsis: January 7, 2021, was not a good day for Goya Foods CEO Robert Bob Unanue, who has been at the helm of Goya since 2004. On that day, the nine-member board of directors of Goya censured Unanue for publicly questioning the legitimacy of the 2021 United States Presidential election. A day before, on January 6, a mob “trapped lawmakers and vandalized the home of Congress in the worst desecration of the complex since British forces burned it in 1814” (Hockstein, 2021). Unanue was considered a follower of former president Trump and has expressed that “the country was […] blessed to have a leader like President Trump, who is a builder” (Hawkins, 2020). In January 2021, Unanue appeared on Fox News and said a “ war was coming,” as Joe Biden’s election was “unverified.” These, among other words, motivated the censured by the board of Goya Foods, Inc. (Santana and Isidore, 2021). Students are asked the following questions for discussion: Did the board of directors of Goya Foods carry its role too far by openly censuring Unanue? Did Unanue go too far by openly expressing subjective opinions and thus influencing how people view the election results? Should he have remained as CEO of Goya Foods after his words on Joe Biden’s election?

In addition, graduate students of corporate governance, business ethics, social responsibility and leadership, among other classes, will be the target segments for the case. Learning objectives: 1.

Emergent research on this phenomenon has explored the prevalence, impacts and risks of increasing CEO activism for firms. However, very little research has explored the individual and institutional factors that motivate CEO activism. This project attempts to refocus this nascent field by exploring the gendered, racial, sexual and organizational factors that motivate leaders to speak out on issues ranging from DEI, gun control, climate change, Black Lives Matter and #MeToo. Method: To answer our research question - who speaks? - we examined CEOs, companies, and key social issues within the Proquest Newsstand Database. First, we conducted a large exploratory study of random men and women CEOs to determine if gender differences exist. Next, we examined all women CEOs in the Fortune 500 and S&P 500 between 2019–2021 to provide a more thorough and nuanced analysis. Results: We find that women CEOs are more likely to speak out compared to men CEOs. Further, we find that BIPOC and LGBTQ+ CEOs are more likely to engage in activism compared to other CEOs. We also find that the market value of the firm and the presence of women on the board of directors serve as significant predictors of CEO activism compared to other firms. Conclusion: We consider the implications of these findings for the appointment, tenure and visibility of historically underrepresented CEOs. © 2023 by the Southwestern Social Science Association.","2023","2025-02-07 22:27:55","2025-02-07 22:27:55","","521 – 534","","4","104","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Number: 4 Type: Article","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The steadily growing number of such statements made in recent years has been subject to a flourishing academic debate. This field offers first profound findings from observational studies. However, the discussion of CEO activism lacks a thorough theoretical grounding, such as a shared concept accounting for the heterogeneity of sociopolitical incidents. Thus, the aim of this paper is to provide an archetypal framework for CEO activism. Design/methodology/approach: The authors used a multiple case study approach on 145 activism cases stated by CEOs and found seven distinct statement archetypes. Findings: The study identifies four main structural design elements accounting for the heterogeneity of activism, i.e. the addressed meta-category of the statement, the targeted outcome, the used tonality and the orientation of the CEOs’ positions. Further, the authors found seven distinguishable archetypes of CEO activism statements: “Climate Alerts”, “Economy Visions”, “Political Comments”, “Self-reflections and Social Concerns”, “Tech Designs”, “Unclouded Evaluations” and “Descriptive Explanations”. Research limitations/implications: This typology classifies the heterogeneity of CEO activism. It will enable the analysis of interrelationships, mechanisms and motivations on a differentiated level and raise the comprehensibility of research-results. Practical implications: The framework supports executives in understanding the heterogeneity of CEO activism and to analyse personality-fits. Originality/value: To the authors’ knowledge, this marks the first conceptualisation of activism developed cross-thematically. The work supports further theory-building on CEO activism. © 2024, Franz Rumstadt, Dominik K. Kanbach, Josef Arweck, Thomas K.

Building on and extending the insights from political theories of organizations, this paper explores how the historical shift from managerial to investor capitalism has reshaped firm-level power dynamics over executive succession, contributing to the rise of outsider succession. Three developments were particularly crucial-the growth of institutional ownership, the strengthening of internal monitoring by the board, and the rise of shareholder activism. Using data on the complete histories of CEO succession at 686 large U.S. corporations between 1981 and 2005, this article shows how these new developments have pluralized firm-level power struggles over executive succession and thus have further politicized the process. The importance of firm-level power dynamics in the process suggests that a shift in the dominant institutional logic does not directly translate into a new corporate practice, but that such translation depends on the outcome of firm-level power dynamics. © The Author(s) 2013.","2014","2025-02-07 22:27:55","2025-02-07 22:27:55","","727 – 764","","5","35","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Number: 5 Type: Article","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Many people are simply fed up with the current state of affairs and want to see people in power held accountable. As a result, CEOs are taking public stances on timely issues. They are doing so not only because they want to win favor with their employees and customers but also because they feel an obligation—and pressure—to speak up and pursue greater good on behalf of others since they have platforms and visibility that are not shared by those whose lack similar status or vehicles to for their voices to be heard. This is a qualitative study that involved in-depth interviews with 24 CEO activists. Data analysis followed the hermeneutic phenomenological approach. The findings advance the CEO activism literature by focusing on the tactical repertoire of activist CEOs within the non-Western context of Ghana. Activist CEOs in Ghana use a broader portfolio of tactics than previously thought, offer a typology of CEO activism tactics, and help to internationalize CEO activism research.

Analyzing 10 years of corporate communication by Blackrock CEO Larry Fink, we show how his corporate activist rhetoric suggests a growing disregard for dialogic communication, which is typically articulated within American public relations scholarship as a vital component in, for example, Grunig’s Excellence Theory and Heath’s rhetorical perspectives. This analysis of Fink’s communication further suggests the need for American public relations scholarship to move beyond a false binary between external and internal approaches to activism, which is further complicated by Fink’s seeming lack of interest in dialogic communication. Relatedly, we note that the mainstream conception of public relations as a consensus-oriented, good faith exchange seems at odds with the emerging reality of a societal disposition for mere assertions.

Settlements are more likely when the activist has a credible threat to win board seats in a proxy fight and when incumbents’ reputation concerns are stronger. Consistent with incomplete contracting, face-saving benefits, and private information considerations, settlements commonly do not contract directly on operational or leadership changes sought by the activist but rather on board composition changes. Settlements are accompanied by positive stock price reactions, and they are subsequently followed by changes of the type sought by activists, including CEO turnover, higher shareholder payouts, and improved operating performance. We find no evidence to support concerns that settlements enable activists to extract rents at the expense of other investors.

Furthermore, firms with CEO activism realize increased shareholdings from investors with a greater liberal leaning, who rebalance their portfolios toward these firms. Our results suggest that investors’ socio-political preferences are an important channel through which CEO activism affects equity demand and stock prices. Notably, CEOs are less likely to be fired when their activist stances generate positive market responses. © 2023 INFORMS.","2024","2025-02-07 22:27:55","2025-02-07 22:27:55","","6519 – 6549","","10","70","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Number: 10 Type: Article","","","","Chief executive officer; Chief executive officer activism; Commerce; Firm value; Institutional investors; Market reactions; Market response; Political issues; Shareholdings; Social issues; Stock price","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Therefore, this paper integrates authentic leadership into signaling theory to identify CEO sociopolitical activism—a public and costly expression of personal political values by a company's highest and most visible leader—as an effective signal that is interpreted by job seekers to evaluate the CEOs’ degree of authentic leadership. Three experiments, including a parallel design for causal mediation inferences, and a field survey support that authentic leadership attributions mediate the positive impact of CEOs’ activism on job seekers’ employer attractiveness evaluations and employer choice. This mediation is attenuated when the activist CEO's espoused political values are incongruent with those of the job seeker and when the CEO engages in activism due to customer pressure rather than personal convictions. These findings primarily contribute to signaling theory and the literature on authentic leadership. For practitioners, the paper identifies a unique leadership signal that can contribute to an employer brand while cautioning about the costs this signal might impose on companies’ diversity. © The Author(s) 2022.","2023","2025-02-07 22:27:55","2025-02-07 22:27:55","","2727 – 2765","","8","49","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Number: 8 Type: Article","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Engaging in such activism could be risky for executives, given its potential to appease some stakeholders while alienating others. This begs the question: Why do some CEOs become sociopolitical activists while others remain on the “sidelines”? This study addresses this question by exploring the notion of the executive “bully pulpit” and how CEOs leverage their status and reputation to publicly engage in sociopolitical activism. Research Findings/Insights: Drawing from the status and reputation literature, we explore the effect of CEO power, CEO celebrity status, and firm reputation as predictors of CEO sociopolitical activism. In doing so, we focus on the “bully pulpit” explanation by arguing that powerful, high-status CEOs and those who lead firms with good reputations are more likely to use their professional position and visibility to advocate for or against controversial sociopolitical issues. Our analysis of CEO sociopolitical activism data from 246 matched-pair S&P 500 firms from 2007 to 2020 largely supports our arguments, though we find there is an important interaction between firm reputation and both CEO power and celebrity. Theoretical/Academic Implications: This study extends current research insights by highlighting how power, status, and reputation at the CEO and firm levels create a formidable platform (a “bully pulpit”) from which executive sociopolitical activism is exercised. Given its nascent nature, scholars are just beginning to empirically explore the consequences of CEO sociopolitical activism. This study contributes to ongoing work in this area by providing empirical evidence on the nature and drivers of CEO sociopolitical activism. Practitioner/Policy Implications: Firms seeking to play a more proactive role in contemporary sociopolitical issues need to consider hiring high-profile CEOs. Additionally, highly reputed firms are well-positioned to support their CEOs' efforts in influencing societal debates on controversial issues. © 2024 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","2024","2025-02-07 22:27:55","2025-02-07 22:27:55","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this study, we address the less-explored activities that constitute CEO activism beyond single stances as the activism is maintained over time. The data cover 6 years of campaign and media materials from a case company with several CEO-initiated activist campaigns. Our findings from an inductive analysis contribute to CEO activism theorizing in three ways. First, we extend CEO activism conceptually by identifying five underlying activities that support a public stance: anchoring motivations, modeling action, taking agency, enduring criticism, and normalizing activism. Second, we bridge individual- and organization-level analyses by depicting how a CEO involves a company in activism through activities that justify interrelated topic frame and role frame. Third, we develop a processual model that includes the pre-stance, stance-taking, and post-stance phases and explains how the underlying activities are interrelated and follow a pattern that serves to maintain CEO activism. Accordingly, CEO activism includes activities, through the pre-stance, stance-taking, and post-stance phases, whereby a CEO deliberately engages personally and through a company in public debate about sensitive socio-political issues and the role of businesses in addressing them. © The Author(s) 2022.","2023","2025-02-07 22:27:55","2025-02-07 22:27:55","","646 – 694","","3","62","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Number: 3 Type: Article","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We examine this phenomenon in the context of short seller activism, which occurs when an activist short seller publicly denounces a firm to drive down its stock price. Implicit motives are motivational dispositions that operate outside of an individual's conscious awareness. We find that CEOs' implicit needs for achievement and power are associated with a decrease in competitive intensity following short seller activism, implying that implicit motives can lead CEOs to avoid behaviors that they fear may result in failure or the exposure of weakness in the wake of an external threat. This study contributes to research on external threats and corporate governance by highlighting the role of CEOs' implicit motives in shaping firms' responses to activists. We emphasize the importance of integrating implicit motives into upper echelons research.

I seek to develop an initial understanding of this phenomenon by examining some of the critical consequences of CEOs’ public responses to social activist challenges. Drawing on instrumental stakeholder theory and social movement theory, I recognize the dualistic nature of CEOs’ public responses to social activist challenges; that is, a single response can influence both the direct pressure received from the focal social activists confronting the firm as well as the potential pressure the firm could face in the form of additional challenges. I argue that a CEO’s accommodative public response—seen by social activists as a sign that the CEO and firm are aligned with their beliefs, values, and motivations—will be negatively associated with the focal social activists’ willingness to punish the firm. At the same time, however, a CEO’s accommodative public response sends a broader signal—reflective of the CEO and firm’s relative openness to social activism and social issues—that will be positively associated with the perceived attractiveness of the firm’s corporate opportunity structure for social activism, increasing the potential for the firm to receive additional social activist challenges. I conduct a laboratory experiment based on a real-life case and find support for my arguments. The results yield important implications for research on strategic leadership, stakeholder strategy, and social movements. © The Author(s) 2020.","2022","2025-02-07 22:27:55","2025-02-07 22:27:55","","45 – 80","","1","61","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Number: 1 Type: Article","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Ultimately, the paper seeks to arrive at a better conceptual understanding of CEO advocates and activists from a communication science perspective. Design/methodology/approach: This paper is conceptual and considers findings from the literature on personalization, reputation, issues and topic management. Findings: The paper reflects media, receptive and strategic implications for CEO advocates and activists and derives four workable propositions. It lays the foundation for treating CEO advocacy and activism as a form of strategic topic management that harnesses personalization to address a new set of stakeholder demands. Practical implications: The insights gained from this paper may help researchers and practitioners understand when CEOs should speak up, what to communicate and how. The human element behind this kind of communication echoes new expectations, demands and values from stakeholders, shareholders and society at large. Social implications: Understanding the specific interdependencies between personalization, reputation, issues and topic management underlying CEO advocacy and activism can help to improve a CEO's relationship with stakeholders and guide the public discourse to actively bring about positive societal change. Originality/value: The paper fills a gap by providing an understanding of advocate and activist CEOs from a communication science perspective.

Design/methodology/approach – A quantitative survey was conducted among top executives of listed and private companies operating in the largest European country, Germany (n¼602). Findings – The study identifies a traditional mindset: top executives focus on primary stakeholders (customers, employees) instead of secondary stakeholders (politicians, activists), they value mass media higher than social media, and they rate speaking more important than listening. Moreover, communication professionals are not always the first choice when CEOs and board members reflect on the topics at hand. Advanced visions of strategic communication developed in academia and practice have not yet arrived in many boardrooms. Research limitations/implications – The sample is not representative for all CEOs in corporations and it is limited to one country. Originality/value – While the performance of corporate communications depends heavily on the perceptions, beliefs, and expectations that top executives hold towards communication and its contribution to organizational goal, little is known about this. Most knowledge is based on qualitative interviews and small-scale samples.
