In particular, it focuses on the ideological alignment between a firm's upper echelons and its general employees. We theorize that participation in progressive corporate activism reflects the ideological views of both the top management team and general employees. By examining firm participation in letter campaigns supporting progressive causes, our findings indicate that ideological alignment between a top management teams and general employees' liberal political leanings is associated with a firm's participation in progressive corporate activism. The CEO's own ideological preferences do not have an independent association with this kind of activism. This article concludes with a discussion of implications for our understanding of corporate political action and nonmarket strategy.Managerial SummaryThis article looks at the relationship between political ideology and firm participation in sociopolitical activism. Although some have argued that firms' activism reflects a CEO's ideological preferences or employee activism, we find that neither explanation fully accounts for the kinds of companies that engage in this kind of activism. We find that progressive corporate activism reflects the ideological views of both top management and general employees. Our findings suggest that companies that have ideological alignment on progressive issues are more likely to take public stands on those issues because the stands reinforce core values held by employees and the top management.","2024-12","2025-02-06 16:37:35","2025-02-06 21:08:38","","2459-2518","","12","45","","","","","","","","","","English","","","ABI/INFORM Collection; International Bibliography of the Social Sciences (IBSS)","3128088807","","","Place: Chicago Publisher: Wiley Periodicals Inc.","","","https://libkey.io/libraries/3027/openurl?ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&ctx_enc=info:ofi/enc:UTF-8&rfr_id=info:sid/ProQuest&rft_val_fmt=journal&rft.genre=article&rft.jtitle=Strategic+Management+Journal&rft.atitle=When+ideologies+align%3A+Progressive+corporate+activism+and+within%E2%80%90firm+ideological+alignment&rft.au=McKean%2C+Anna+E%3BKing%2C+Brayden+G.&rft.aulast=McKean&rft.aufirst=Anna&rft.date=2024-12-01&rft.volume=45&rft.issue=12&rft.spage=2459&rft.isbn=&rft.btitle=&rft.title=Strategic+Management+Journal&rft.issn=01432095&rft_id=info:doi/10.1002%2Fsmj.3632","Activism; Business And Economics--Management; Chief executives; corporate activism; Corporate activism; Corporate management; Corporates; Employees; Human resource management; Ideology; Liberalism; Management journals; Management teams; Non-market strategy; nonmarket strategy; Organizational behavior; Participation; Political action; Political activism; Political ideologies; political ideology; Social activism; social movements; Social movements; Sociopolitical factors; Strategic management; Top management; Top management teams; upper echelons; Upper echelons; Upper management","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Furthermore, firms with CEO activism realize increased shareholdings from investors with a greater liberal leaning, who rebalance their portfolios toward these firms.

Our study complements this literature by using two controlled experiments and a series of semi‐structured interviews with CEOs and CFOs to investigate how a CEO's response to shareholder activism influences investors' reactions and whether these reactions differ depending on the gender of the CEO or on how their response is explained. In the first experiment, we find that investors evaluate a firm as less attractive when a female CEO uses an uncooperative response rather than a cooperative response to shareholder activism, absent any explanation for the CEO's response. Conversely, investors evaluate a firm as less attractive when a male CEO uses a cooperative response rather than an uncooperative response. In the second experiment, where there is an added explanation for the CEO response, we find that investors react more positively to a female CEO's uncooperative response when the explanation is more communal (vs. agentic). Our interviews with CEOs and CFOs provide insights into how the gender of firms' leadership may play a role when activist shareholders target firms. Our results collectively suggest that investors rely on gender stereotypes when evaluating the responses of male and female executives to shareholder activism and that these evaluations affect their investment judgments. Our results also suggest a potential alternative explanation for the finding that female CEOs are more likely to cooperate with activist shareholders than are male CEOs. Rather than inherent differences in the management styles of male and female CEOs, responses to activist shareholders may be driven, at least in part, by managers anticipating that they will be penalized by investors for deviating from gender‐stereotypical behavior.Alternate abstract:RésuméLe genre du PDG et les réactions à l'activisme actionnarialDes études récentes ont mis en lumière que les entreprises dirigées par des femmes sont davantage ciblées par des actionnaires activistes et que les femmes PDG sont plus enclines à prendre en compte les demandes de ces derniers. Cette étude apporte une contribution significative en réalisant deux expériences contrôlées et en menant des entretiens semi‐structurés avec des PDG et des directeurs financiers. Les auteurs examinent l'influence de la réaction d'un PDG face à l'activisme actionnarial sur les investisseurs, en fonction du genre du PDG ou de l'explication donnée à sa réponse. Dans la première expérience, les investisseurs perçoivent négativement une entreprise lorsque c'est une femme PDG qui réagit à l'activisme actionnarial en ne favorisant pas la collaboration, plutôt qu'en la favorisant, sans aucune explication de la réponse du PDG. À l'inverse, les investisseurs perçoivent négativement une entreprise lorsque c'est un homme PDG qui réagit à l'activisme actionnarial en favorisant la collaboration plutôt qu'en ne la favorisant pas. Dans la deuxième expérience, où la réponse du PDG est expliquée, les investisseurs réagissent de manière plus positive quand une femme PDG favorise la collaboration, surtout si l'explication est plus communale (que agentique). Les entretiens avec les PDG et les directeurs financiers soulignent le rôle du genre du dirigeant dans la gestion de l'activisme actionnarial. Les investisseurs semblent se baser sur des stéréotypes de genre pour évaluer les réactions des dirigeants masculins et féminins à l'activisme actionnarial, ce qui influence leurs décisions d'investissement. Ces résultats suggèrent aussi une autre explication possible au fait que les femmes PDG sont plus susceptibles que les hommes PDG de collaborer avec les actionnaires activistes. Au‐delà des différences de style de gestion entre PDG masculins et féminins, les réactions de ces derniers face à l'activisme actionnarial peuvent être provoquées, du moins en partie, par la crainte d'être sanctionnés par les investisseurs s'ils ne se conforment pas aux comportements stéréotypés associés à leur genre.","2024","2025-02-06 16:37:35","2025-02-06 21:08:21","","1726-1753","","3","41","","","","","","","","","","English","","","ABI/INFORM Collection; International Bibliography of the Social Sciences (IBSS)","3105621046","","","Place: Toronto Publisher: Canadian Academic Accounting Association","","","https://libkey.io/libraries/3027/openurl?ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&ctx_enc=info:ofi/enc:UTF-8&rfr_id=info:sid/ProQuest&rft_val_fmt=journal&rft.genre=article&rft.jtitle=Contemporary+Accounting+Research&rft.atitle=CEO+gender+and+responses+to+shareholder+activism&rft.au=Jackson%2C+Scott+C%3BRennekamp%2C+Kristina+M%3BSteenhoven%2C+Blake+A.&rft.aulast=Jackson&rft.aufirst=Scott&rft.date=2024-10-01&rft.volume=41&rft.issue=3&rft.spage=1726&rft.isbn=&rft.btitle=&rft.title=Contemporary+Accounting+Research&rft.issn=08239150&rft_id=info:doi/10.1111%2F1911-3846.12962","Activism; activisme actionnarial; Activists; Business And Economics--Accounting; CEO gender; Chief executive officers; Chief executives; Collaboration; Companies; engagement des investisseurs; Females; Gender; Gender differences; Gender stereotypes; Genre; genre du PDG; Interviews; investor engagement; Investors; Leadership; Males; Management styles; shareholder activism; Shareholder activism; Stereotyped behaviour; Stockholders","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Building on gender socialisation theory and the managerial power perspective, and with 2350 firm‐year observations from Standard and Poor's (S&P) 1500 companies in the United States for the years 2010–2018, we find that environmental activists display a greater propensity to target firms led by women CEO–Chairs at the shareholder proposal filing stage, while no significant preference is observed towards general women directors or CEOs. To explore the rationale behind this preference—whether it stems from gender discrimination or socialisation—we extend our investigation to the withdrawal stage and identify a significantly positive influence from both women CEOs and CEO–Chairs, with the influence from CEO–Chairs being more pronounced. We postulate that both the managerial power and women's socialised traits (such as being more altruistic, collaborative and communicative) are plausible explanations for this gender effect, and women without substantial legitimate power in environmental matters are unable to exert a significant impact.","2024-09","2025-02-06 16:37:35","2025-02-06 21:08:28","","5195-5213","","6","33","","","","","","","","","","English","","","ABI/INFORM Collection; International Bibliography of the Social Sciences (IBSS)","3123664424","","","Place: Chichester Publisher: Wiley Periodicals Inc.","","","https://libkey.io/libraries/3027/openurl?ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&ctx_enc=info:ofi/enc:UTF-8&rfr_id=info:sid/ProQuest&rft_val_fmt=journal&rft.genre=article&rft.jtitle=Business+Strategy+and+the+Environment&rft.atitle=Gender+diversity+and+environmental+activism%3A+Gender+discrimination+or+socialisation%3F&rft.au=Yu%2C+Jialing%3BYang%2C+Stephanie+Liu.&rft.aulast=Yu&rft.aufirst=Jialing&rft.date=2024-09-01&rft.volume=33&rft.issue=6&rft.spage=5195&rft.isbn=&rft.btitle=&rft.title=Business+Strategy+and+the+Environment&rft.issn=09644733&rft_id=info:doi/10.1002%2Fbse.3751","Activism; Altruism; Chief executives; Environmental activism; environmental shareholder activism; Environmental Studies; Environmentalism; Filing; Gender; gender discrimination; gender disparity; gender diversity; gender socialisation theory; management; managerial power; Power; Sex discrimination; Shareholder activism; Social; Socialization; Stockholders; United States; Women; women directors on corporate boards; womens status","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Using a sample of 3,259 activism events from 2004 to 2016, we identify 1,623 activist directors. Compared to other newly appointed directors, these activist directors tend to be younger, more likely to have finance and accounting skills, and less likely to be female. We find that the likelihood of acquiring board representation is associated with weaker market performance or lower payout ratios. Following the appointment of an activist director, we find evidence of increased divestiture, decreased acquisition activity, higher CEO turnover, increased leverage, higher payouts, and reduced investment. Our analysis of data on activists’ stated demands also shows that activist directors are effective in helping activists achieve their goals, consistent with the notion that board representation is an important mechanism for activists to bring about desired changes. Finally, we find positive abnormal returns of 1% when an activist director is appointed and a 3.2%-point increase in return on assets over the subsequent five years with an activist-affiliated director.","2024-09","2025-02-06 16:37:35","2025-02-06 21:08:18","","2578-2616","","3","29","","","","","","","","","","English","","","ABI/INFORM Collection","3089700328","","","Place: New York Publisher: Springer Nature B.V.","","","https://libkey.io/libraries/3027/openurl?ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&ctx_enc=info:ofi/enc:UTF-8&rfr_id=info:sid/ProQuest&rft_val_fmt=journal&rft.genre=article&rft.jtitle=Review+of+Accounting+Studies&rft.atitle=Activist+directors%3A+determinants+and+consequences&rft.au=Gow%2C+Ian+D.%3BShin%2C+Sa-Pyung+Sean%3BSrinivasan%2C+Suraj.&rft.aulast=Gow&rft.aufirst=Ian&rft.date=2024-09-01&rft.volume=29&rft.issue=3&rft.spage=2578&rft.isbn=&rft.btitle=&rft.title=Review+of+Accounting+Studies&rft.issn=13806653&rft_id=info:doi/10.1007%2Fs11142-023-09767-8","52394:Portfolio Management and Investment Advice; Activists; Boards of directors; Business And Economics--Accounting; Hedge funds; Shareholder activism","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Yet, CEOs are increasingly choosing sides in societal debates despite the inherent risk of alienating stakeholders who disagree with the CEO's stance. Even more puzzlingly, conservative CEOs sometimes espouse liberal stances in such debates, which runs counter to the otherwise consistent evidence in the upper echelons literature that CEOs are guided by their own values in their actions. Our study addresses this paradox by examining the antecedents of CEO liberal activism, with an emphasis on the interplay between the CEO's ideology and the prevailing ideological tilt of the employee population in driving CEOs' activism decisions. Drawing on the concept of managerial discretion, or latitude of action, we theorize that a pronounced organizational ideology constrains a CEO's ability to act in accordance with their own values-particularly in the highly symbolic domain of activism. We also argue that conservative CEOs are relatively more focused on instrumental rationales for activism, whereas liberal CEOs tend to prioritize more intrinsic rationales, a consequence of which is that conservative CEOs more heavily weight organizational ideology in their activism decisions. We test our theory in the context of a highly publicized letter signed by nearly 100 CEOs of public companies in opposition to North Carolina's controversial 2016 ""bathroom bill."" Relying on a variety of novel data sources, we find robust support for our theory.","2024-08","2025-02-06 16:37:35","2025-02-06 21:08:38","","1388","","4","35","","","","","","","","","","English","","","ABI/INFORM Collection; International Bibliography of the Social Sciences (IBSS); ProQuest One Psychology","3086410136","","","Place: Linthicum Publisher: Institute for Operations Research and the Management Sciences","","","https://libkey.io/libraries/3027/openurl?ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&ctx_enc=info:ofi/enc:UTF-8&rfr_id=info:sid/ProQuest&rft_val_fmt=journal&rft.genre=article&rft.jtitle=Organization+Science&rft.atitle=Why+Do+Some+Conservative+CEOs+Publicly+Support+Liberal+Causes%3F+Organizational+Ideology%2C+Managerial+Discretion%2C+and+CEO+Sociopolitical+Activism&rft.au=Wowak%2C+Adam+J%3BBusenbark%2C+John+R.&rft.aulast=Wowak&rft.aufirst=Adam&rft.date=2024-07-01&rft.volume=35&rft.issue=4&rft.spage=1388&rft.isbn=&rft.btitle=&rft.title=Organization+Science&rft.issn=10477039&rft_id=info:doi/10.1287%2Forsc.2022.17160","Activism; Business And Economics--Management; Business history; Chief executive officers; Chief executives; Corporate culture; Corporate governance; Ideology; Social issues; Sociopolitical factors; State laws; Taboos","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Merging agency and socioemotional wealth (SEW) arguments, this paper analyzes how effective SOP voting results are among listed family firms in terms of CEO compensation efficiency and equity. Using a sample of UK listed firms from 2011 to 2018, our results show that SOP effectiveness is positively influenced by family ownership and is strongly moderated by family involvement in management and in governance as well as by family generation. Our findings stress the strong family effect and the ethical perceptions of family shareholders on SOP voting, showing how family participation in the firm encourages fairer and more aligned CEO compensation packages.

The framework was supported by an online survey with 575 full-time U.S. employees. Our study sheds light on how CEOs can unleash the power of their activism in promoting a moral climate within their organization and producing a collective impact among their followers to enhance societal well-being.","2024-05","2025-02-06 16:37:35","2025-02-06 21:08:23","","210-232","","3","36","","","","","","","","","","English","","","ABI/INFORM Collection","3060966727","","","Place: Philadelphia Publisher: Taylor & Francis Ltd.","","","https://libkey.io/libraries/3027/openurl?ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&ctx_enc=info:ofi/enc:UTF-8&rfr_id=info:sid/ProQuest&rft_val_fmt=journal&rft.genre=article&rft.jtitle=Journal+of+Public+Relations+Research&rft.atitle=Channeling+Employees%26rsquo%3B+Positive+Moral+Emotions+in+CEO+Activism%3A+The+Role+of+Care-Oriented+Leadership+Communication&rft.au=Ji%2C+Yi+Grace%3BWeiting+Tao.&rft.aulast=Ji&rft.aufirst=Yi&rft.date=2024-05-01&rft.volume=36&rft.issue=3&rft.spage=210&rft.isbn=&rft.btitle=&rft.title=Journal+of+Public+Relations+Research&rft.issn=1062726X&rft_id=info:doi/10.1080%2F1062726X.2024.2311147","Advertising And Public Relations; CEO activism; employee advocacy; ethics of care; organizational virtuousness; positive moral emotions","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Research on this practice has been primarily concerned with determining the conditions under which a CEO’s public statements on sociopolitical issues are beneficial or detrimental to her firm’s business performance. We complement this instrumental perspective on CEO activism with an ethical investigation of the implications of CEO activism for the democratic process. Drawing on political philosophy, we show that the answer to the question of whether CEO activism is conducive to the democratic process depends on the view of democracy that is adopted. From the perspective of liberalism, the sole requirement that an instance of CEO activism must fulfill is that it is lawful, provided that the applicable law sufficiently protects people’s essential rights. However, from the viewpoint of republicanism, this is not a sufficient condition. Besides being law-abiding, CEOs should be “civic-minded” when intervening in public debates, i.e., concerned with the quality and fairness with which those debates are conducted. Based on the literature on republicanism, we suggest four possible criteria that civic-minded CEOs can apply to gauge the democratic conduciveness of a possible public intervention: added insight, timeliness, constructiveness, and transparency. Our article complements the predominantly instrumentally oriented literature on CEO activism and contributes, more broadly, to the literature that explores the normative dimensions of corporate political involvement, as well as to a growing strand of research that draws on philosophical theory to inform business leaders’ ethical decision-making.","2024-04","2025-02-06 16:37:35","2025-02-06 21:08:38","","755-774","","4","190","","","","","","","","","","English","","","ABI/INFORM Collection; International Bibliography of the Social Sciences (IBSS); PAIS Index; ProQuest One Psychology","3032867139","","","Place: Dordrecht Publisher: Springer Nature B.V.","","; ","https://media.proquest.com/media/hms/PFT/1/00ZqX?_a=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%2BgIBToIDA1dlYooDHENJRDoyMDI1MDIwNjE2MDgzMzEzOToxMTg1MDM%3D&_s=SBFH9rFD2Kb9y4akMuoxo6wuao4%3D; https://libkey.io/libraries/3027/openurl?ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&ctx_enc=info:ofi/enc:UTF-8&rfr_id=info:sid/ProQuest&rft_val_fmt=journal&rft.genre=article&rft.jtitle=Journal+of+Business+Ethics&rft.atitle=When+Is+CEO+Activism+Conducive+to+the+Democratic+Process%3F%3A+JBE&rft.au=Feix%2C+Aur%C3%A9lien%3BWernicke%2C+Georg.&rft.aulast=Feix&rft.aufirst=Aur%C3%A9lien&rft.date=2024-04-01&rft.volume=190&rft.issue=4&rft.spage=755&rft.isbn=&rft.btitle=&rft.title=Journal+of+Business+Ethics&rft.issn=01674544&rft_id=info:doi/10.1007%2Fs10551-023-05446-5","Activism; Business; Business ethics; Chief executive officer; Chief executives; Debates; Decision making; Democracy; Ethical dilemmas; Ethics; Executives (Business); Law; Liberalism; Political participation; Political philosophy; Republicanism; Transparency","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The steadily growing number of such statements made in recent years has been subject to a flourishing academic debate. This field offers first profound findings from observational studies. However, the discussion of CEO activism lacks a thorough theoretical grounding, such as a shared concept accounting for the heterogeneity of sociopolitical incidents. Thus, the aim of this paper is to provide an archetypal framework for CEO activism.Design/methodology/approachThe authors used a multiple case study approach on 145 activism cases stated by CEOs and found seven distinct statement archetypes.FindingsThe study identifies four main structural design elements accounting for the heterogeneity of activism, i.e. the addressed meta-category of the statement, the targeted outcome, the used tonality and the orientation of the CEOs’ positions. Further, the authors found seven distinguishable archetypes of CEO activism statements: “Climate Alerts”, “Economy Visions”, “Political Comments”, “Self-reflections and Social Concerns”, “Tech Designs”, “Unclouded Evaluations” and “Descriptive Explanations”.Research limitations/implicationsThis typology classifies the heterogeneity of CEO activism. It will enable the analysis of interrelationships, mechanisms and motivations on a differentiated level and raise the comprehensibility of research-results.Practical implicationsThe framework supports executives in understanding the heterogeneity of CEO activism and to analyse personality-fits.Originality/valueTo the authors’ knowledge, this marks the first conceptualisation of activism developed cross-thematically. The work supports further theory-building on CEO activism.","2024","2025-02-06 16:37:35","2025-02-06 21:08:20","","370-397","","13","63","","","","","","","","","","English","","","ABI/INFORM Collection","3142704992","","","Place: London Publisher: Emerald Group Publishing Limited","","; ","https://media.proquest.com/media/hms/PFT/1/RG4qa?_a=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&_s=fqsIreNi5COxIaxGUTnQpT1fNLA%3D; https://libkey.io/libraries/3027/openurl?ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&ctx_enc=info:ofi/enc:UTF-8&rfr_id=info:sid/ProQuest&rft_val_fmt=journal&rft.genre=article&rft.jtitle=Management+Decision&rft.atitle=CEO+activism+is+not+equal+to+CEO+activism%3A+a+typology+of+executives%27+political+statements&rft.au=Rumstadt%2C+Franz%3BKanbach%2C+Dominik+K%3BArweck%2C+Josef%3BMaran%2C+Thomas+K%3BStubner%2C+Stephan.&rft.aulast=Rumstadt&rft.aufirst=Franz&rft.date=2024-01-01&rft.volume=63&rft.issue=13&rft.spage=370&rft.isbn=&rft.btitle=&rft.title=Management+Decision&rft.issn=00251747&rft_id=info:doi/10.1108%2FMD-07-2023-1297","Business And Economics--Management; CEO activism; Communication; Corporate social responsibility; Executives; Hypotheses; Non-market strategy; Political activism; Social activism; Social responsibility; Stakeholders; Typology; United States--US","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In our model consumers care about the type of firm they buy from, but also understand that corporate leaders can make false or misleading statements to pander to valuable demographics. We show that, although the profitability of CEO activism is severely compromised by this wokewashing, under some conditions credible, value‐enhancing sociopolitical communications can still take place. We characterize (i) when corporate leaders prefer to stay silent; (ii) when wokewashing is so widespread that no credible communication is possible; and (iii) when instead some credible communication can take place. We also show how an intrinsically motivated CEO can destroy or increase firm value.Managerial SummaryMany corporate leaders take public stances on sociopolitical issues and observers suggest that this practice can sometimes create firm value. A problem with the idea, however, is that, if taking a certain stance is indeed value enhancing, then many other CEOs may be tempted to take the same stance opportunistically. In this article, we study how CEO activism can be profitable when wokewashing is a real concern. We show that credible, value‐enhancing sociopolitical communications require controversial messages, as significant opposition from consumers with different worldviews is necessary to ensure the credibility of communications. Far from being a “bug,” controversy is a feature of credible CEO activism. We also demonstrate that a CEO's intrinsic motivation to take a stand can sometimes create value by making communications more credible. Obliquely, then, a CEO not primarily motivated by profits may be the best at maximizing profits.","2023-12","2025-02-06 16:37:35","2025-02-06 21:08:20","","3098-3121","","13","44","","","","","","","","","","English","","","ABI/INFORM Collection; International Bibliography of the Social Sciences (IBSS)","2889140354","","","Place: Chicago Publisher: Wiley Periodicals Inc.","","","https://libkey.io/libraries/3027/openurl?ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&ctx_enc=info:ofi/enc:UTF-8&rfr_id=info:sid/ProQuest&rft_val_fmt=journal&rft.genre=article&rft.jtitle=Strategic+Management+Journal&rft.atitle=Cashing+in+on+the+culture+wars%3F+CEO+activism%2C+wokewashing%2C+and+firm+value&rft.au=Melloni%2C+Gaia%3BPatacconi%2C+Andrea%3BVikander%2C+Nick.&rft.aulast=Melloni&rft.aufirst=Gaia&rft.date=2023-12-01&rft.volume=44&rft.issue=13&rft.spage=3098&rft.isbn=&rft.btitle=&rft.title=Strategic+Management+Journal&rft.issn=01432095&rft_id=info:doi/10.1002%2Fsmj.3542","Activism; Business And Economics--Management; CEO activism; cheap talk; Cheap talk; Chief executive officer; Chief executives; Communication; Condition; Consumers; Corporate leaders; Credibility; Culture wars; Firm value; Intrinsic motivation; Management journals; Profitability; Profits; Socio-political issues; Sociopolitical factors; strategic communication; Strategic communication; Strategic management; wokewashing; Wokewashing; Worldview","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We further examine whether the presence of external monitors, such as foreign and institutional investors, can moderate the impact of political connections on the performance of firms in Pakistan. In addition, we explore the association between political connections and firm performance during election and non-election years. This study uses 2479 firm-year observations for firms listed on the Stock Exchange of Pakistan from 2010 to 2019 as the final sample and uses regression to test the hypotheses. The findings of this study show that political connections are negative and strongly significant across all three performance indicators, such as ROA, ROE, and Tobin’s Q, indicating that political connections can harm firm value. Further analyses indicate that the detrimental impact of political connections on firm performance is attributable to CEOs who have political connections and is more pronounced during general election years in Pakistan. The findings further report some weak evidence of the monitoring roles played by foreign and institutional in mitigating the negative impact of political connections. Policymakers in Pakistan, therefore, ought to design stricter disclosure measures to limit the potential wealth expropriation in politically connected firms, given the lack of shareholder activism by outside shareholders in this country. Our results further suggest that external monitors, such as foreign and institutional ownership, play a relatively limited role in mitigating the adverse impact of political connections on the performance of firms.","2023-12","2025-02-06 16:37:35","2025-02-06 21:08:36","","","","2","10","","","","","","","","","","English","","","ABI/INFORM Collection; Publicly Available Content Database","2859758588","","","Place: Abingdon Publisher: Taylor & Francis Ltd.","","; ","https://media.proquest.com/media/hms/PFT/1/KoyZX?_a=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%2BgIBWYIDA1dlYooDHENJRDoyMDI1MDIwNjE2MDgzMzEzOToxMTg1MDM%3D&_s=X3mTCJWFbqo6tLHvxJLitfgUwoo%3D; https://libkey.io/libraries/3027/openurl?ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&ctx_enc=info:ofi/enc:UTF-8&rfr_id=info:sid/ProQuest&rft_val_fmt=journal&rft.genre=article&rft.jtitle=Cogent+Business+%26+Management&rft.atitle=Types+of+political+connections%2C+election+years%2C+and+firm+performance+in+Pakistan%3A+Moderating+role+of+external+monitoring&rft.au=Muhammad+Saif+Ul+Islam%3BWong%2C+Woei-Chyuan%3BMohd+Yushairi+Bin+Mat+Yusoff.&rft.aulast=Muhammad+Saif+Ul+Islam&rft.aufirst=&rft.date=2023-12-01&rft.volume=10&rft.issue=2&rft.spage=&rft.isbn=&rft.btitle=&rft.title=Cogent+Business+%26+Management&rft.issn=&rft_id=info:doi/10.1080%2F23311975.2023.2224139","Business And Economics--Management; connected CEO; connected chairman; election years; external monitoring; Financial performance; Foreign investment; Foreign investors; Institutional investor; Investment; non-election years; Pakistan; performance of firm; Political behavior; Political connections","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It shows how the socio-political context manifested in national and transnational policies, regulations and other socio-political events can influence the CEO talk about sustainability.Design/methodology/approachThis study adopts an interpretative and qualitative method of analysis using the lenses of the theoretical concepts of framing and legitimacy, analysing CEOs’ letters from 10 multinational industrial companies based in Sweden, over the period of 2008–2019.FindingsThe results show that various discourses of sustainability, emerging from policies and regulatory initiatives, socio-political events and civil society activism, are reflected in the ways CEOs frame sustainability over time. This article reveals that CEOs not only lead the discourse of profitable sustainability, but they also slowly adapt their sustainability talk to other discourses led by the policymakers, regulators and civil society. This pattern of a slow adaptation is especially visible in a period characterised by increased discourses of climate urgency and regulations related to social and environmental sustainability.Research limitations/implicationsThe theoretical frame is built by integrating the concepts of legitimacy and framing. Appreciating dynamic notions of legitimacy and framing, the study suggests a novel view of reporting as a film series, presenting many frames of sustainability over time. It helps the study to conceptualise CEO framing of sustainability as adaptive framing. This study suggests using a dynamic notion of adaptive framing in future longitudinal studies of corporate- and accounting communication.Practical implicationsThe results show that policymakers, regulators and civil society, through their initiatives, influence the CEOs' framing of sustainability. It is thus important for regulators to substantiate sustainability-related discourses and develop conceptual tools and language of social and environmental sustainability that can lead CEO framing more effectively.Originality/valueThe study engages with Goffman's notion of dynamic framing.

Therefore, this paper integrates authentic leadership into signaling theory to identify CEO sociopolitical activism—a public and costly expression of personal political values by a company's highest and most visible leader—as an effective signal that is interpreted by job seekers to evaluate the CEOs’ degree of authentic leadership. Three experiments, including a parallel design for causal mediation inferences, and a field survey support that authentic leadership attributions mediate the positive impact of CEOs’ activism on job seekers’ employer attractiveness evaluations and employer choice. This mediation is attenuated when the activist CEO's espoused political values are incongruent with those of the job seeker and when the CEO engages in activism due to customer pressure rather than personal convictions. These findings primarily contribute to signaling theory and the literature on authentic leadership.

Evidence from SOEs in China","Corporate Governance : An International Review","","09648410","10.1111/corg.12510","https://www.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/when-does-female-leadership-advantage-exist/docview/2891933902/se-2?accountid=12006","Research Question/IssueWe approach the ongoing debate in the literature on when and why a female leadership advantage exists in the context of China. In particular, we examine whether female CEOs outperform male CEOs in state‐owned enterprises (SOEs).Research Findings/InsightsWe show that a female leadership advantage exists in SOEs. We find that the female leadership increased performance is attributed to improved profitability, capital structure, and operating efficiency. The magnitude of this gender effect is bigger in central state‐owned enterprises (CSOEs) than that in local state‐owned enterprises (LSOEs). The results are robust to additional tests that mitigate the sample selection and other endogeneity concerns.Theoretical/Academic ImplicationsWe use the role congruity theory to motivate and develop the hypotheses drawing insights upon the literature in psychology and leadership. Female CEOs are perceived as less congruent with their leadership roles given the gender role stereotypes. Thus, they face more challenges and difficulties than male CEOs. These obstacles take at least two forms which are significant in SOEs: shareholder activism and sex discrimination. Female CEOs have to outperform their male counterparts to alleviate the pressure from shareholder activism and showcase their managerial skills and abilities.Practitioner/Policy ImplicationsFor the state shareholders, the extra scrutiny in selecting female CEOs should be lifted given this outperformance. The evidence is also relevant for CEOs to choose their career paths among different types of firms, for boards of directors on their strategic decisions on CEO hiring, and for policy makers to promote the female leadership advantage.","2023-11","2025-02-06 16:37:35","2025-02-06 21:08:37","","945-970","","6","31","","","","","","","","","","English","","","ABI/INFORM Collection; International Bibliography of the Social Sciences (IBSS)","2891933902","","","Place: Oxford Publisher: Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","","","https://libkey.io/libraries/3027/openurl?ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&ctx_enc=info:ofi/enc:UTF-8&rfr_id=info:sid/ProQuest&rft_val_fmt=journal&rft.genre=article&rft.jtitle=Corporate+Governance+%3A+An+International+Review&rft.atitle=When+does+a+female+leadership+advantage+exist%3F+Evidence+from+SOEs+in+China&rft.au=Li%2C+Hanchen%3BTong%2C+Xiaochuan.&rft.aulast=Li&rft.aufirst=Hanchen&rft.date=2023-11-01&rft.volume=31&rft.issue=6&rft.spage=945&rft.isbn=&rft.btitle=&rft.title=Corporate+Governance+%3A+An+International+Review&rft.issn=09648410&rft_id=info:doi/10.1111%2Fcorg.12510","Activism; Advantages; Business And Economics; Capital structure; Career development; Chief executive officers; Chief executives; China; corporate governance; female leadership advantage; Females; firm performance; Gender; Gender roles; government ownership; Hiring; Leadership; Males; Policy making; Profitability; Psychology; Role congruity theory; Scrutiny; Sex discrimination; Shareholder activism; State-owned enterprise; Stereotypes; Stockholders","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Using qualitative thematic analysis of CrossFit affiliates’ Facebook and Instagram posts made during June 2020, we find that the affiliates had a range of responses that included silence, reconsideration of their affiliate status, and social activism. Furthermore, we find that the affiliates’ focus on (re)defining community served to deflect from deeper discussions of systemic racism within CrossFit and the CrossFit community.","2023-09","2025-02-06 16:37:35","2025-02-06 21:08:36","","312-320","","3","40","","","","","","","","","","English","","","Sociological Abstracts","3163626702","","","Place: Champaign Publisher: Human Kinetics Publishers, Inc.","","","https://libkey.io/libraries/3027/openurl?ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&ctx_enc=info:ofi/enc:UTF-8&rfr_id=info:sid/ProQuest&rft_val_fmt=journal&rft.genre=article&rft.jtitle=Sociology+of+Sport+Journal&rft.atitle=%26ldquo%3BThey+Do+Not+Represent+Our+Gym%26rdquo%3B%3A+How+CrossFit+Affiliates+Define+Community+as+They+Respond+to+Racial+Controversy&rft.au=Edmonds%2C+Shaun%3BMalcom%2C+Nancy+L%3BGipson%2C+Christina+M%3BBennett%2C+Hannah.&rft.aulast=Edmonds&rft.aufirst=Shaun&rft.date=2023-09-01&rft.volume=40&rft.issue=3&rft.spage=312&rft.isbn=&rft.btitle=&rft.title=Sociology+of+Sport+Journal&rft.issn=07411235&rft_id=info:doi/10.1123%2Fssj.2022-0074","activism; Activism; article; Community; human; human experiment; social media; Social media; Sociology; structural racism; Systemic racism; thematic analysis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The results indicate that appointments of CEOs who are recruited with shareholder activist influence are associated with more favorable stock market reactions and stronger profitability improvements than appointments without activist involvement. In contrast, I find little evidence that shareholder influence is followed by the recruitment of CEOs who implement myopic corporate policies. Additional analyses reveal positive associations between activist involvement and (1) the amount of resources being dedicated to the CEO search process and (2) the propensity to recruit CEOs from outside the firm. These findings extend the CEO labor market literature, which so far focuses mainly on the decision to remove incumbent CEOs and provides limited insights into CEO recruiting.","2023-09","2025-02-06 16:37:35","2025-02-06 21:08:32","","353","","5","98","","","","","","","","","","English","","","ABI/INFORM Collection; International Bibliography of the Social Sciences (IBSS)","2867358850","","","Place: Sarasota Publisher: American Accounting Association","","","https://libkey.io/libraries/3027/openurl?ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&ctx_enc=info:ofi/enc:UTF-8&rfr_id=info:sid/ProQuest&rft_val_fmt=journal&rft.genre=article&rft.jtitle=The+Accounting+Review&rft.atitle=Shareholder+Activists+and+Frictions+in+the+CEO+Labor+Market&rft.au=Keusch%2C+Thomas.&rft.aulast=Keusch&rft.aufirst=Thomas&rft.date=2023-09-01&rft.volume=98&rft.issue=5&rft.spage=353&rft.isbn=&rft.btitle=&rft.title=The+Accounting+Review&rft.issn=00014826&rft_id=info:doi/10.2308%2FTAR-2020-0485","Activists; Appointments & personnel changes; Chief executive officer; Chief executive officers; Chief executives; Education; Hiring; Labor market; Profitability; Recruitment; Securities markets; Shareholder; Shareholder activism; Stockholders","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Yet we do not fully understand how these activist investors, despite holding only a small stake in target firms, are able to influence management and the board to acquiesce to their demands, especially given the large uncertainty that their demands will improve shareholder value. Building on impression management (IM) theory, we propose that activist investors who express their concerns and demands with high confidence in their letters to target firms are likely to be perceived as knowledgeable and competent by the firm's other shareholders, thus influencing the response of the firm's management and board. In support of this theoretical proposition, results of our empirical analysis of 475 U.S. activist campaigns against U.S. companies between 2007 and 2019 suggest that confidence in tone in an activist's letter, as a form of self-promotion, is positively associated with campaign success. We also observe that the positive association between confidence in tone in activist letters and campaign success is less for activists with greater success in prior campaigns and in campaigns with multiple activists. Our paper contributes to financial activism research by showing that activists' verbal impression management can serve as an effective influence tactic in their campaigns. Our study also contributes to the emerging research stream on verbal IM by introducing a language attribute, confidence in tone, that has not been studied in management research and is distinct from past constructs examined in verbal IM research.","2023-08","2025-02-06 16:37:35","2025-02-06 21:08:24","","1487","","4","34","","","","","","","","","","English","","","ABI/INFORM Collection; International Bibliography of the Social Sciences (IBSS); ProQuest One Psychology","2843131640","","","Place: Linthicum Publisher: Institute for Operations Research and the Management Sciences","","","https://libkey.io/libraries/3027/openurl?ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&ctx_enc=info:ofi/enc:UTF-8&rfr_id=info:sid/ProQuest&rft_val_fmt=journal&rft.genre=article&rft.jtitle=Organization+Science&rft.atitle=%26quot%3BDear+CEO+and+Board%26quot%3B%3A+How+Activist+Investors%27+Confidence+in+Tone+Influences+Campaign+Success&rft.au=Brauer%2C+Matthias%3BWiersema%2C+Margarethe%3BBinder%2C+Philipp.&rft.aulast=Brauer&rft.aufirst=Matthias&rft.date=2023-07-01&rft.volume=34&rft.issue=4&rft.spage=1487&rft.isbn=&rft.btitle=&rft.title=Organization+Science&rft.issn=10477039&rft_id=info:doi/10.1287%2Forsc.2022.1625","52394:Portfolio Management and Investment Advice; Activism; Activists; Business And Economics--Management; Campaigns; Confidence; Hedge funds; Impression management; Investors; Selfpromotion; Shareholder activism; Shareholder value; Stockholders; Strategic communication; Success; Uncertainty; United States--US","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Emergent research on this phenomenon has explored the prevalence, impacts and risks of increasing CEO activism for firms. However, very little research has explored the individual and institutional factors that motivate CEO activism. This project attempts to refocus this nascent field by exploring the gendered, racial, sexual and organizational factors that motivate leaders to speak out on issues ranging from DEI, gun control, climate change, Black Lives Matter and #MeToo.MethodTo answer our research question ‐ who speaks? ‐ we examined CEOs, companies, and key social issues within the Proquest Newsstand Database. First, we conducted a large exploratory study of random men and women CEOs to determine if gender differences exist. Next, we examined all women CEOs in the Fortune 500 and S&P 500 between 2019–2021 to provide a more thorough and nuanced analysis.ResultsWe find that women CEOs are more likely to speak out compared to men CEOs. Further, we find that BIPOC and LGBTQ+ CEOs are more likely to engage in activism compared to other CEOs. We also find that the market value of the firm and the presence of women on the board of directors serve as significant predictors of CEO activism compared to other firms.ConclusionWe consider the implications of these findings for the appointment, tenure and visibility of historically underrepresented CEOs.","2023-07","2025-02-06 16:37:35","2025-02-06 21:08:38","","521-534","","4","104","","","","","","","","","","English","","","ABI/INFORM Collection; International Bibliography of the Social Sciences (IBSS); Sociological Abstracts; Worldwide Political Science Abstracts","2836858153","","","Place: Oxford Publisher: Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","","","https://libkey.io/libraries/3027/openurl?ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&ctx_enc=info:ofi/enc:UTF-8&rfr_id=info:sid/ProQuest&rft_val_fmt=journal&rft.genre=article&rft.jtitle=Social+Science+Quarterly&rft.atitle=Who+speaks%3F+Individual+and+institutional+predictors+of+CEO+activism&rft.au=Cook%2C+Alison%3BGlass%2C+Christy%3BIngersoll%2C+Alicia+R.&rft.aulast=Cook&rft.aufirst=Alison&rft.date=2023-07-01&rft.volume=104&rft.issue=4&rft.spage=521&rft.isbn=&rft.btitle=&rft.title=Social+Science+Quarterly&rft.issn=00384941&rft_id=info:doi/10.1111%2Fssqu.13276","Activism; Black Lives Matter movement; Board of directors; CEO activism; Chief executive officer; Chief executives; Climate change; Databases; diversity; Executives (Business); Firearm laws & regulations; Gender differences; gender in leadership; LGBTQ people; Market value; Organizational factors; Political factors; Research; Social issues; Social Sciences: Comprehensive Works; Visibility; Women; women CEOs","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The purpose of this paper is to explore the antecedents and motivations of CEO sociopolitical activism in a typology of influences internal and external to the CEO and to the organization. This study’s typology highlights the need for greater understanding of CEOs’ sociopolitical activism for the CEO as an individual actor and for the company they represent.Design/methodology/approachThis study’s approach is to conceptually review the literature on CEO activism and to create a theoretic framework for future analysis of the antecedents and motivations and ramifications of CEOs’ sociopolitical activism for the CEO as an individual actor and for the company they represent. The author highlights four theories and seeks future application of these theories to the phenomena in a typology.FindingsThe typology highlights the application of management theories to various ramifications of CEO activism to four influences on CEO activities. Upper echelons theory helps explain the motivation of a CEO internally, whereas agency theory applies to CEO activism internal to the CEO and external to the organizational operations. External to the CEO, organizational culture theory supports responses internal to the organization, and stakeholder theory provides insight into responses external to the CEO and the organization.Originality/valueThis study provides conceptual support for the study of CEO activism and encourages future research on the topic.","2023","2025-02-06 16:37:35","2025-02-06 21:08:37","","422-438","","3","18","","","","","","","","","","English","","","ABI/INFORM Collection","2829680231","","","Place: Bradford Publisher: Emerald Group Publishing Limited","","; ","https://media.proquest.com/media/hms/PFT/1/pGFUS?_a=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&_s=TuGgBN%2B1HNWtV%2BBYQg%2BlrY3jl5g%3D; https://libkey.io/libraries/3027/openurl?ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&ctx_enc=info:ofi/enc:UTF-8&rfr_id=info:sid/ProQuest&rft_val_fmt=journal&rft.genre=article&rft.jtitle=Society+and+Business+Review&rft.atitle=What+did+they+say%3F+A+typology+of+CEO+activism&rft.au=Cycyota%2C+Cynthia+S.&rft.aulast=Cycyota&rft.aufirst=Cynthia&rft.date=2023-07-01&rft.volume=18&rft.issue=3&rft.spage=422&rft.isbn=&rft.btitle=&rft.title=Society+and+Business+Review&rft.issn=17465680&rft_id=info:doi/10.1108%2FSBR-05-2022-0154","Activism; Activists; Boards of directors; CEO activism; Chief executive officer; Chief executive officers; Competition; Consumer attitudes; Customers; Decision making; Employee activism; Employees; Freedom of religion; Indiana; Influence; LGBTQ people; Organizational governance; Political activism; Shareholder activism; Social responsibility; Sociology; Sociopolitical actions; Sociopolitical factors; Stakeholder Theory; Stakeholders; State laws; United States--US","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Corporate giving discourages managers from pursuing external financing, especially debt issuance, to minimize outside monitoring. It creates preferences for internally financed cash acquisitions for the same reason. These distortions reduce shareholder wealth. Following both the 2003 dividend tax cut and hedge fund activism, corporate charitable contributions fall while investment rises, suggesting suboptimal investment caused by managerial private benefit extraction. Acquisition announcements of firms making large charitable contributions show negative stock market reactions that are more pronounced for acquirers with poor corporate governance.Theoretical/Academic ImplicationsOur findings suggest that due to agency problems and managerial rent extraction, corporate philanthropic activities can distort corporate financing and investment decisions and yield corporate charitable contribution allocations that personally benefit a firm's CEO at shareholder expense.Practitioner/Policy ImplicationsAs corporate philanthropy imposes a significant cost to shareholders, managers may seek shareholder approval on corporate philanthropic activities. The Securities and Exchange Commission may also require timely disclosure of corporate donations.","2023-05","2025-02-06 16:37:35","2025-02-06 21:08:30","","464-490","","3","31","","","","","","","","","","English","","","ABI/INFORM Collection; International Bibliography of the Social Sciences (IBSS)","2810749147","","","Place: Oxford Publisher: Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","","","https://libkey.io/libraries/3027/openurl?ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&ctx_enc=info:ofi/enc:UTF-8&rfr_id=info:sid/ProQuest&rft_val_fmt=journal&rft.genre=article&rft.jtitle=Corporate+Governance+%3A+An+International+Review&rft.atitle=Private+benefits+of+corporate+philanthropy+and+distortions+to+corporate+financing+and+investment+decisions&rft.au=Masulis%2C+Ronald+W%3BSyed%2C+Walid+Reza.&rft.aulast=Masulis&rft.aufirst=Ronald&rft.date=2023-05-01&rft.volume=31&rft.issue=3&rft.spage=464&rft.isbn=&rft.btitle=&rft.title=Corporate+Governance+%3A+An+International+Review&rft.issn=09648410&rft_id=info:doi/10.1111%2Fcorg.12476","Business And Economics; Charities; corporate giving; corporate governance; Corporate governance; Donations; Extraction; Financing; financing decisions; hedge fund activism; Investment decision; investment decisions; Investments; Philanthropy; private benefits of control; Private benefits of control; Securities markets; Stockholders; Wealth","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this study, we address the less-explored activities that constitute CEO activism beyond single stances as the activism is maintained over time. The data cover 6 years of campaign and media materials from a case company with several CEO-initiated activist campaigns. Our findings from an inductive analysis contribute to CEO activism theorizing in three ways. First, we extend CEO activism conceptually by identifying five underlying activities that support a public stance: anchoring motivations, modeling action, taking agency, enduring criticism, and normalizing activism. Second, we bridge individual- and organization-level analyses by depicting how a CEO involves a company in activism through activities that justify interrelated topic frame and role frame. Third, we develop a processual model that includes the pre-stance, stance-taking, and post-stance phases and explains how the underlying activities are interrelated and follow a pattern that serves to maintain CEO activism. Accordingly, CEO activism includes activities, through the pre-stance, stance-taking, and post-stance phases, whereby a CEO deliberately engages personally and through a company in public debate about sensitive socio-political issues and the role of businesses in addressing them.","2023-03","2025-02-06 16:37:35","2025-02-06 21:08:16","","646-694","","3","62","","","","","","","","","","English","","","ABI/INFORM Collection; Sociological Abstracts","2785880708","","","Place: Chicago Publisher: SAGE PUBLICATIONS, INC.","","","https://libkey.io/libraries/3027/openurl?ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&ctx_enc=info:ofi/enc:UTF-8&rfr_id=info:sid/ProQuest&rft_val_fmt=journal&rft.genre=article&rft.jtitle=Business+and+Society&rft.atitle=A+Processual+Model+of+CEO+Activism%3A+Activities%2C+Frames%2C+and+Phases&rft.au=Olkkonen%2C+Laura%3BMorsing+Mette.&rft.aulast=Olkkonen&rft.aufirst=Laura&rft.date=2023-03-01&rft.volume=62&rft.issue=3&rft.spage=646&rft.isbn=&rft.btitle=&rft.title=Business+and+Society&rft.issn=00076503&rft_id=info:doi/10.1177%2F00076503221110184","Activism; Business And Economics; CEO activism; Chief executive officer; Chief executive officers; Companies; corporate activism; frames; Framing; Political factors; processual model; Stance","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Simultaneously, the general public is increasingly politically polarized. We examine how CEOs' support for gun control after two mass shootings differentially affected the behavior of liberal and conservative consumers and the persistence of these effects. Using mobile phone location data to measure store‐level visits, we find (a) consumer visits to stores decreased by 3%; (b) this decrease was asymmetric: visits in the most conservative counties decreased by about 5% but did not change in the most liberal counties; and (c) these effects dissipated within 10 weeks after activism. Our results highlight the strategic implications for executives pressured to take stances on controversial issues.Managerial SummaryWe study how consumers respond to CEO support for gun control, and how consumers' partisan views influence their behavior. Visits to the stores of several major retailers declined about 3% in the 4 weeks after their CEOs supported expanding background checks for gun purchases. In the most liberal counties, visits did not change following CEO support for gun control, while in the most conservative counties visits declined about 5%. Hence, the reaction of liberal consumers did not counteract the reaction of conservative consumers. We find, however, that these effects dissipated within 10 weeks; as a result, retailers whose CEOs supported gun control did not experience any long‐term, net decrease in sales despite the short‐term sales decrease in conservative counties.","2023-03","2025-02-06 16:37:35","2025-02-06 21:08:33","","672-703","","3","44","","","","","","","","","","English","","","ABI/INFORM Collection; International Bibliography of the Social Sciences (IBSS)","2772897895","","","Place: Chicago Publisher: Wiley Periodicals Inc.","","","https://libkey.io/libraries/3027/openurl?ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&ctx_enc=info:ofi/enc:UTF-8&rfr_id=info:sid/ProQuest&rft_val_fmt=journal&rft.genre=article&rft.jtitle=Strategic+Management+Journal&rft.atitle=The+effects+of+CEO+activism%3A+Partisan+consumer+behavior+and+its+duration&rft.au=Hou%2C+Young%3BPoliquin%2C+Christopher+W.&rft.aulast=Hou&rft.aufirst=Young&rft.date=2023-03-01&rft.volume=44&rft.issue=3&rft.spage=672&rft.isbn=&rft.btitle=&rft.title=Strategic+Management+Journal&rft.issn=01432095&rft_id=info:doi/10.1002%2Fsmj.3451","Activism; Business And Economics--Management; CEO activism; Chief executive officer; Chief executives; Consumer behavior; Consumer behaviour; Consumers; Core business; Firearm laws & regulations; Firearms; General publics; Gun control; guns; Management journals; Mass murders; Mobile phones; Non-market strategy; nonmarket strategy; polarization; political consumerism; Political consumerism; Political issues; Political polarization; Sales; Social issues; Strategic management; Visits","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We find that changes in compensation in the two-year window surrounding the release of CCLs are negatively associated with the number of disclosure defects identified in CCLs, and that this association is driven by defects that relate directly to pay or the method by which it was determined, rather than broader governance- or readability-related defects. Cross-sectional analyses suggest that the negative impact of a CCL on excess CEO compensation is concentrated in firms with overpaid CEOs and less powerful CEOs. We further show that total disclosure defects, pay-related defects and governance-related defects are positively associated with the likelihood that the subject firm experiences low shareholder support in subsequent ‘say-on-pay’ votes, suggesting that enhanced visibility of excess pay and resulting shareholder activism may be one channel through which pressure is brought to bear on firms to reduce excess compensation.","2022-12","2025-02-06 16:37:35","2025-02-06 21:08:31","","1089-1118","","5","31","","","","","","","","","","English","","","ABI/INFORM Collection; International Bibliography of the Social Sciences (IBSS)","2746712802","","","Place: London Publisher: Taylor & Francis Ltd.","","","https://libkey.io/libraries/3027/openurl?ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&ctx_enc=info:ofi/enc:UTF-8&rfr_id=info:sid/ProQuest&rft_val_fmt=journal&rft.genre=article&rft.jtitle=European+Accounting+Review&rft.atitle=SEC+Compensation-related+Comment+Letters+and+Excess+CEO+Compensation&rft.au=Wang%2C+Weixiao%3BZhang%2C+Lijuan%3BWilson%2C+Mark%3BTejshree+Kala.&rft.aulast=Wang&rft.aufirst=Weixiao&rft.date=2022-12-01&rft.volume=31&rft.issue=5&rft.spage=1089&rft.isbn=&rft.btitle=&rft.title=European+Accounting+Review&rft.issn=09638180&rft_id=info:doi/10.1080%2F09638180.2022.2046120","Business And Economics--Accounting; Chief executive officer; Chief executive officers; Chief executives; Compensation; Corporate Disclosure; Corporate Governance; Excess Compensation; Executive compensation; Executive Compensation; Governance; Readability; SEC Comment Letters; Stockholders; Visibility","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We examine how Chief Executive Officer (CEO) gender influences retail investors' responses to proxy contests. We find that these investors are more likely to support-through their proxy voting behavior-campaigns that target female-led versus male-led firms, despite the fact that retail investors evaluate female and male CEOs similarly. We show that this apparent discrepancy is a function of how subjective ratings mask stereotype-influenced judgments, consistent with the shifting standards model (SSM). Respondents use lower standards to evaluate female versus male CEOs. This difference becomes apparent when externally-anchored judgments are employed, such as when investors are asked to choose sides in a proxy contest. Correspondingly, activists are judged as relatively more competent when targeting female-led firms. Our findings contribute to research on CEO gender and activism. In doing so, our research also introduces the SSM to the investor decision-making literature, thereby enriching the discussion about what mechanisms underpin the less favorable investment outcomes female-led firms can experience.

We find strong support for this prediction using 15 years of data on the S&P 1,500 firms and an instrument based on director age at time of hire. We also find that an LTID adds more value to firms that are complex or mature, had more CEOs during the LTID's tenure, and have less entrenched management. Post hoc analyses of director deaths and shareholder class action lawsuits and activist motions provide additional evidence that LTIDs add value to the firms on whose boards they serve.Managerial SummaryWe study whether having a long‐tenured independent director (LTID) on the board has implications for firm performance. In general, we find that firms with an LTID perform better than firms without one. The performance benefits accrue primarily to firms that have complex operations, are in the mature stage of their lifecycle, and had more CEOs during the LTID's tenure. That said, firms with entrenched management do not benefit from having an LTID. We also find that firms with an LTID experience fewer class action lawsuits and shareholder activist motions and that the stock market reacts adversely to the death of an LTID. Overall, the evidence is that LTIDs offer valuable experience and stability to the firms on whose boards they serve.","2022-08","2025-02-06 16:37:35","2025-02-06 21:08:30","","1602-1634","","8","43","","","","","","","","","","English","","","ABI/INFORM Collection; International Bibliography of the Social Sciences (IBSS)","2690659535","","","Place: Chicago Publisher: Wiley Periodicals Inc.","","","https://libkey.io/libraries/3027/openurl?ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&ctx_enc=info:ofi/enc:UTF-8&rfr_id=info:sid/ProQuest&rft_val_fmt=journal&rft.genre=article&rft.jtitle=Strategic+Management+Journal&rft.atitle=Long%E2%80%90tenured+independent+directors+and+firm+performance&rft.au=Bonini%2C+Stefano%3BDeng%2C+Justin%3BFerrari%2C+Mascia%3BKose%2C+John%3BDavid+Gaddis+Ross.&rft.aulast=Bonini&rft.aufirst=Stefano&rft.date=2022-08-01&rft.volume=43&rft.issue=8&rft.spage=1602&rft.isbn=&rft.btitle=&rft.title=Strategic+Management+Journal&rft.issn=01432095&rft_id=info:doi/10.1002%2Fsmj.3370","Activists; Board; boards; Business And Economics--Management; Chief executive officer; Chief executives; Class action lawsuits; Companies; Complex operations; corporate governance; Corporate governance; Director; firm performance; Firm Performance; Independent directors; Life cycle; Litigation; Motivation; Organizational performance; Performance benefits; Scandals; Securities markets; Shareholders; Stockholders; tenure; Tenure","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Yet more and more CEOs are taking visible public stands on hotly contested issues, engaging in what has come to be called CEO sociopolitical activism. Despite its growing prevalence and potentially major implications, this class of executive behaviors remains largely unexplored by organizational scholars. Our study tests and elaborates on stakeholder alignment theory to investigate the influence of CEO activism on employees’ attitudes and behaviors, particularly its effects on employees’ organizational commitment and support for the ideology underpinning the CEO’s public stance. Our theoretical predictions hinge on the degree of alignment between the CEO’s stance and the prevailing ideological tilt of the employee population, as well as the degree to which employees view the CEO as a credible leader. We test our ideas in the context of a highly publicized letter signed by nearly 100 public company CEOs in opposition to North Carolina’s controversial 2016 “bathroom bill.” Relying on multiple data sources to examine differences between firms whose CEOs signed the letter and firms whose CEOs declined the invitation to sign, we find general support for our theory, indicating that CEO activism has important intra- and extra-firm implications.","2022-06","2025-02-06 16:37:35","2025-02-06 21:08:28","","553-593","","2","67","","","","","","","","","","English","","","ABI/INFORM Collection; International Bibliography of the Social Sciences (IBSS); ProQuest One Psychology; Sociological Abstracts; Worldwide Political Science Abstracts","2665519943","","","Place: Thousand Oaks Publisher: SAGE PUBLICATIONS, INC.","","","https://libkey.io/libraries/3027/openurl?ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&ctx_enc=info:ofi/enc:UTF-8&rfr_id=info:sid/ProQuest&rft_val_fmt=journal&rft.genre=article&rft.jtitle=Administrative+Science+Quarterly&rft.atitle=How+Do+Employees+React+When+Their+CEO+Speaks+Out%3F+Intra-+and+Extra-Firm+Implications+of+CEO+Sociopolitical+Activism&rft.au=Wowak%2C+Adam+J%3BBusenbark%2C+John+R%3BHambrick%2C+Donald+C.&rft.aulast=Wowak&rft.aufirst=Adam&rft.date=2022-06-01&rft.volume=67&rft.issue=2&rft.spage=553&rft.isbn=&rft.btitle=&rft.title=Administrative+Science+Quarterly&rft.issn=00018392&rft_id=info:doi/10.1177%2F00018392221078584","Activism; Behavior; CEO prototypicality; CEO regard; Chief executive officer; chief executive officers (CEOs); Chief executives; Employee attitude; Employees; Executives (Business); Ideology; Letters (Correspondence); Organization theory; Organizational commitment; organizational political ideology; Political ideologies; political ideology; Sociology; sociopolitical activism; Sociopolitical factors; stakeholders; State laws","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We examine this phenomenon in the context of short seller activism, which occurs when an activist short seller publicly denounces a firm to drive down its stock price. Implicit motives are motivational dispositions that operate outside of an individual's conscious awareness. We find that CEOs' implicit needs for achievement and power are associated with a decrease in competitive intensity following short seller activism, implying that implicit motives can lead CEOs to avoid behaviors that they fear may result in failure or the exposure of weakness in the wake of an external threat. This study contributes to research on external threats and corporate governance by highlighting the role of CEOs' implicit motives in shaping firms' responses to activists.

In particular, corporate statements that directly address the issues around the protests are identified and possible mechanisms underlying how these may impact shareholder value are discussed.Design/methodology/approach>The authors first use a qualitative research approach of content and sentiment analysis to track how companies or their chief executive officers (CEOs) present their stance against racial injustice, as represented by their use of linguistic markers. Then, the authors use an event study methodology to assess the response from stock market participants.Findings>The findings suggest that CEOs primarily convey their stance using language that is emotive and empathic. In addition, shareholders earn a significant abnormal return of 2.13%, on average, in the three days following the release of the statements.Research limitations/implications>This study considered only US-listed companies. The sample size, also, is relatively small. Institutional and cultural differences across countries may also vary. Thus, future research could explore the extent to which the findings generalize to other contexts.Practical implications>Results provide insights to top managers who communicate with various stakeholders on emotionally charged social issues.

The executive’s agility to react to financial distress determines the probability of bankruptcy. Proper governance drives sound and sustainable, value maximising decision-making, while inept practices lead to value diminishing, self-serving behaviour that financially constrains companies, resulting in an acceleration of financial distress. This study examined the correlation between financial distress and corporate governance within a sample of 116 listed South African companies using the GMM estimation. Key financial distress determinants were found to be audit committees and shareholder activism (proxied by equity ownership) that may deter investor apathy, “director opportunism” and CEO dominance. Also, long-tenured CEOs and post-graduate directors possess contextually enriched latent knowledge that may assist distressed firms, particularly if the trade-offs between director’s remuneration and governance is well managed. Furthermore, the K-score model served as a robust financial distress proxy since it allowed the interrogation of grey zone companies. These findings provided financial distress determinants aiding decision-making for ailing businesses to avoid liquidation, which can be of use to regulatory bodies and policymakers in developing sustainable governance strategies.","2022-01","2025-02-06 16:37:35","2025-02-06 21:08:18","","","","1","10","","","","","","","","","","English","","","ABI/INFORM Collection; International Bibliography of the Social Sciences (IBSS); Publicly Available Content Database","2770809046","","","Place: London Publisher: Taylor & Francis Ltd.","","; ","https://media.proquest.com/media/hms/PFT/1/OnM8U?_a=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%2BgIBWYIDA1dlYooDHENJRDoyMDI1MDIwNjE2MDgzMzEzOToxMTg1MDM%3D&_s=17mkoJ%2Fsbp%2FsAAWLqDpe2q8GaGc%3D; https://libkey.io/libraries/3027/openurl?ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&ctx_enc=info:ofi/enc:UTF-8&rfr_id=info:sid/ProQuest&rft_val_fmt=journal&rft.genre=article&rft.jtitle=Cogent+Economics+%26+Finance&rft.atitle=An+econometric+analysis+of+financial+distress+determinants+from+an+emerging+economy+governance+perspective&rft.au=Navitha+Singh+Sewpersadh.&rft.aulast=Navitha+Singh+Sewpersadh&rft.aufirst=&rft.date=2022-01-01&rft.volume=10&rft.issue=1&rft.spage=&rft.isbn=&rft.btitle=&rft.title=Cogent+Economics+%26+Finance&rft.issn=&rft_id=info:doi/10.1080%2F23322039.2021.1978706","Activism; Agency; Apathy; Audit committees; Bankruptcy; Business And Economics; CEO; Chief executives; Companies; corporate governance; Corporate governance; Decision making; directors; Dominance; Economic; Emerging market; Finance; financial distress; Financial distress; Ownership; Policy making; Psychological distress; Regulatory agencies; shareholder activism; South Africa; Stockholders; Sustainability; Value","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

I seek to develop an initial understanding of this phenomenon by examining some of the critical consequences of CEOs’ public responses to social activist challenges. Drawing on instrumental stakeholder theory and social movement theory, I recognize the dualistic nature of CEOs’ public responses to social activist challenges; that is, a single response can influence both the direct pressure received from the focal social activists confronting the firm as well as the potential pressure the firm could face in the form of additional challenges. I argue that a CEO’s accommodative public response—seen by social activists as a sign that the CEO and firm are aligned with their beliefs, values, and motivations—will be negatively associated with the focal social activists’ willingness to punish the firm. At the same time, however, a CEO’s accommodative public response sends a broader signal—reflective of the CEO and firm’s relative openness to social activism and social issues—that will be positively associated with the perceived attractiveness of the firm’s corporate opportunity structure for social activism, increasing the potential for the firm to receive additional social activist challenges.

This study assesses the impact of CEO activism on shareholder value and investigates potential drivers behind the decision to advocate. We conduct an event study centred on a particular episode of CEO activism: the resignation of a group of business leaders from their roles as advisors to President Trump. We choose this setting since activism is likely to have a stronger impact when a CEO is politically connected. However, by engaging in advocacy, a CEO risks severing the very same political links that underlie the strength of the message. We find that shareholders react negatively to the decision to quit a presidential advisory council, which is consistent with a fear of weakening their firm's political influence. The decision to publicly advocate seems to be driven more by a CEO's personal political ideology than by a company's general involvement in corporate social responsibility. We also observe that managers are more likely to take a stand when they are protected by their firm's corporate governance rules. This study provides empirical evidence of the risks associated with CEO activism.","2021-10","2025-02-06 16:37:36","2025-02-06 21:08:36","","1062-1081","","4","32","","","","","","","","","","English","","","ABI/INFORM Collection; International Bibliography of the Social Sciences (IBSS)","2579316187","","","Place: London Publisher: Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","","","https://libkey.io/libraries/3027/openurl?ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&ctx_enc=info:ofi/enc:UTF-8&rfr_id=info:sid/ProQuest&rft_val_fmt=journal&rft.genre=article&rft.jtitle=British+Journal+of+Management&rft.atitle=To+Advocate+or+Not+to+Advocate%3A+Determinants+and+Financial+Consequences+of+CEO+Activism&rft.au=Mascia+Bedendo%3BSiming%2C+Linus.&rft.aulast=Mascia+Bedendo&rft.aufirst=&rft.date=2021-10-01&rft.volume=32&rft.issue=4&rft.spage=1062&rft.isbn=&rft.btitle=&rft.title=British+Journal+of+Management&rft.issn=10453172&rft_id=info:doi/10.1111%2F1467-8551.12459","Activism; Advocacy; Business; Business And Economics--Management; Chief executive officer; Chief executive officers; Chief executives; Corporate governance; Corporate social responsibility; Ideology; Political activism; Political ideologies; Political power; Shareholder value; Social responsibility; Stockholders","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

As CEO talents become more transferable, monitoring, and performance improve more and CEO compensation decreases more at the nontarget firm; shareholder activism becomes less efficient due to the increased linkage between CEOs.

We find that firm fundamentals, the existence of a ""glass cliff,"" gender discrimination bias, and hedge fund activists' inherent characteristics do not explain the observed gender effect. We also find that the transformational leadership style of female CEOs is a plausible explanation for this gender effect: instead of being self-defensive, female CEOs are more likely to communicate and cooperate with hedge fund activists to achieve intervention goals.

Armed with the instrument, this paper estimates firm's distribution, managerial compensation and investment policies in response to a change in the perceived likelihood of HFA interventions.FindingsAn increase in the HFA intervention likelihood leads to increases in shareholder distribution, decreases in CEO pay and investments and increases in operating performance. Compared to the sample average, a one standard deviation increase in the intervention likelihood leads to a 9.29% increase in the firm's payout ratio, a 7.42% decrease in CEO compensation, a 2.67% decrease in capital expenditures and a 4.96% decrease in R&D expenses. These changes are consistent with the threat of intervention curbing managerial empire-building behaviors and improving firm operation. The relationships are causal, significant and robust to a variety of alternative specifications and sample divisions.Originality/valueResults of this paper suggest that as a mechanism for corporate governance, the threat of HFA is effective in preventing corporate policy deviations.

By showing that HFA is an effective and viable mechanism for corporate governance, this study allows policymakers to make more informed decisions to whether increase hedge fund regulations or not.","2021-04","2025-02-06 16:37:36","2025-02-06 21:08:35","","401-415","","3","17","","","","","","","","","","English","","","ABI/INFORM Collection","2526100441","","","Place: Bradford Publisher: Emerald Group Publishing Limited","","; ","https://media.proquest.com/media/hms/PFT/1/nqADJ?_a=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&_s=2EmPHHXupHapzBx6WcPQZT0WqEs%3D; https://libkey.io/libraries/3027/openurl?ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&ctx_enc=info:ofi/enc:UTF-8&rfr_id=info:sid/ProQuest&rft_val_fmt=journal&rft.genre=article&rft.jtitle=International+Journal+of+Managerial+Finance&rft.atitle=The+preventive+effect+of+hedge+fund+activism%3A+investment%2C+CEO+compensation+and+payout+policies&rft.au=Zhu%2C+Caroline+Heqing.&rft.aulast=Zhu&rft.aufirst=Caroline&rft.date=2021-05-01&rft.volume=17&rft.issue=3&rft.spage=401&rft.isbn=&rft.btitle=&rft.title=International+Journal+of+Managerial+Finance&rft.issn=17439132&rft_id=info:doi/10.1108%2FIJMF-04-2020-0181","52394:Portfolio Management and Investment Advice; 52591:Open-End Investment Funds; 52599:Other Financial Vehicles; Activists; Business And Economics--Banking And Finance; Capital expenditures; Chief executive officer; Compensation; Corporate governance; Equity stake; Executive compensation; Hedge fund; Hedge fund activism; Hedge funds; Intervention; Investment; Investments; Mutual fund fire sales; Mutual funds; Personnel policies; Rates of return; Scandals; Securities markets; Shareholder activism; Standard deviation; Stockholders; Variables","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Our theoretical framework highlights the role of competing shareholder demands in providing a salient reference point for a CEO contemplating the implications of tax avoidance for their stock option wealth. In a study of 2,573 publicly listed U.S. firms between 1993 and 2014, we show that the implications of CEO stock option incentives are contingent on whether the firm’s effective tax rate is anticipated to be below or above the tax rate of peer firms – an outcome that the CEO can cast as balancing stakeholder demands. Consistent with our theoretical reasoning, we also show that, both above and below this reference point, the implications of option incentives for corporate tax avoidance are amplified by the level of activist institutional ownership and attenuated by the CEO’s ability to unwind their bond with shareholders through hedging. In doing so, our study offers an impetus for a broader stakeholder approach to governance research examining CEO incentive alignment.","2021-05","2025-02-06 16:37:36","2025-02-06 21:08:32","","782-814","","3","58","","","","","","","","","","English","","","ABI/INFORM Collection; International Bibliography of the Social Sciences (IBSS)","2515975975","","","Place: Oxford Publisher: Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","","","https://libkey.io/libraries/3027/openurl?ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&ctx_enc=info:ofi/enc:UTF-8&rfr_id=info:sid/ProQuest&rft_val_fmt=journal&rft.genre=article&rft.jtitle=The+Journal+of+Management+Studies&rft.atitle=Stakeholder+Agency+Relationships%3A+CEO+Stock+Options+and+Corporate+Tax+Avoidance&rft.au=Zolotoy%2C+Leon%3BDon+O%E2%80%99Sullivan%3BMartin%2C+Geoffrey+P%3BWiseman%2C+Robert+M.&rft.aulast=Zolotoy&rft.aufirst=Leon&rft.date=2021-05-01&rft.volume=58&rft.issue=3&rft.spage=782&rft.isbn=&rft.btitle=&rft.title=The+Journal+of+Management+Studies&rft.issn=00222380&rft_id=info:doi/10.1111%2Fjoms.12623","behavioural agency; Business And Economics--Management; Chief executive officer; Corporate governance; Corporate tax; corporate tax avoidance; Corporate taxes; executive compensation; Governance; Incentives; Ownership; stakeholder agency; Stakeholders; Stock options; Stockholders; Tax avoidance; Tax rates; Taxation; Wealth","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Positioned as an expression of personal morality, such activism is potentially highly influential because of CEOs’ public visibility and associated positional and resource-based power. This paper questions the assumption that CEO activism can only be explained in relation to individual moral action, and illuminates its wider social implications. We critically evaluate the recent upsurge in CEO activism by juxtaposing it against broader social activism, identifying its distinctive characteristics, and empirically examining two recent ‘moral episodes’: the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program and the Fetal Heartbeat Acts (FHAs). Our analysis demonstrates that CEO activism is more heterogeneous than research to date has shown. Building on this analysis, a refined understanding of the character and morality of CEO activism is developed by establishing a typology of its forms. We conclude that while CEO activism is an important and potent new phenomenon, it may not be universally appropriate to regard CEOs as moral leaders. Instead, it is paramount to question the motives and effects of what CEOs do in the name of morality.","2021-05","2025-02-06 16:37:36","2025-02-06 21:08:35","","269-285","","2","170","","","","","","","","","","English","","","ABI/INFORM Collection; International Bibliography of the Social Sciences (IBSS); PAIS Index; ProQuest One Psychology","2512158272","","","Place: Dordrecht Publisher: Springer Nature B.V.","","; ","https://media.proquest.com/media/hms/PFT/1/TYylI?_a=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%2BgIBToIDA1dlYooDHENJRDoyMDI1MDIwNjE2MDgzMzEzOToxMTg1MDM%3D&_s=hyS7u%2FRTuiFSm4usl7c3%2BbeGRYI%3D; https://libkey.io/libraries/3027/openurl?ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&ctx_enc=info:ofi/enc:UTF-8&rfr_id=info:sid/ProQuest&rft_val_fmt=journal&rft.genre=article&rft.jtitle=Journal+of+Business+Ethics&rft.atitle=The+Morality+of+%26ldquo%3Bnew%26rdquo%3B+CEO+Activism%3A+JBE&rft.au=Branicki+Layla%3BBrammer%2C+Stephen%3BPullen%2C+Alison%3BRhodes%2C+Carl.&rft.aulast=Branicki+Layla&rft.aufirst=&rft.date=2021-05-01&rft.volume=170&rft.issue=2&rft.spage=269&rft.isbn=&rft.btitle=&rft.title=Journal+of+Business+Ethics&rft.issn=01674544&rft_id=info:doi/10.1007%2Fs10551-020-04656-5","Activism; Business ethics; CEO activism; Chief executive officer; Chief executives; Childhood; Deferred action for childhood arrivals; Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals; Executives (Business); Fetal heartbeat acts; Law; Morality; Visibility","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Yet, CEOs are increasingly ignoring this dictum and taking public stances on socially contentious issues. We address this relatively unexplored but important phenomenon by developing a theory of CEO sociopolitical activism. Our stakeholder alignment model posits that CEO activism stems foremost from a CEO's personal values but is facilitated (or suppressed) by the CEO's expectation of support from stakeholders, particularly employees and customers. We also highlight the importance of CEO power, celebrity, and narcissism in influencing whether, and how vividly, the CEO's values manifest in activism. Then, following an episode of CEO activism, stakeholders psychologically respond to the leader's action. Those who were ex ante predisposed toward the CEO's public stance will feel pride in their affiliation with the company, and will consequently experience heightened identification with the firm and with the CEO's stance. Stakeholders who were ex ante averse to the CEO's stance will experience diminished identification with the firm, and their oppositional stance will be further cemented. Finally, we juxtapose CEO activism with other society-oriented firm practices (e.g., corporate social responsibility and corporate lobbying) and develop propositions about their independent and joint effects on stakeholder identification.","2021-01","2025-02-06 16:37:36","2025-02-06 21:08:22","","","","1","46","","","","","","","","","","English","","","ABI/INFORM Collection; International Bibliography of the Social Sciences (IBSS); ProQuest One Psychology","2502226736","","","Place: Briarcliff Manor Publisher: Academy of Management","","","https://libkey.io/libraries/3027/openurl?ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&ctx_enc=info:ofi/enc:UTF-8&rfr_id=info:sid/ProQuest&rft_val_fmt=journal&rft.genre=article&rft.jtitle=Academy+of+Management.+The+Academy+of+Management+Review&rft.atitle=CEO+Sociopolitical+Activism%3A+A+Stakeholder+Alignment+Model&rft.au=Hambrick%2C+Donald+C%3BWowak%2C+Adam+J.&rft.aulast=Hambrick&rft.aufirst=Donald&rft.date=2021-01-01&rft.volume=46&rft.issue=1&rft.spage=&rft.isbn=&rft.btitle=&rft.title=Academy+of+Management.+The+Academy+of+Management+Review&rft.issn=03637425&rft_id=info:doi/10.5465%2Famr.2018.0084","Activism; Business And Economics--Management; Celebrities; Celebrity; Chief executive officer; Chief executive officers; Chief executives; Corporate governance; Customers; Lobbying; Narcissism; Social responsibility; Sociopolitical factors; Stakeholders; Values; Wisdom","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Award recipients are psychologists who, by their extraordinary service at a difficult time, improve the lives and contribute to the well-being of people in a large or small geographic area anywhere in the world. The 2020 recipient of the APA International Humanitarian Award was selected by the Board of Directors, as recommended by the Committee on International Relations in Psychology (CIRP). The career of Niels Peter Rygaard, child psychologist and CEO of the Fairstart Foundation, is an extraordinary example of humanitarian service and activism by a psychologist. After 20 years of research, supervision, and development of care systems for deprived, abandoned, and adopted children, Rygaard cofounded the Fairstart Foundation, a global organization that works to create local systems of quality child care for abandoned, refugee, and separated children who are living without parental care. Fairstart provides free international caregiver group training in local languages and has trained more than 500 instructors from partner organizations and governments. Through the work developed by Dr. Rygaard and the Fairstart Foundation, national care competencies have been strengthened, over 40,000 children in 26 countries have been helped, and a better future has been secured for all children.

After we split target companies into the CEO-turnover and non-CEO-turnover sub-samples, we find that only new CEOs in targeted companies get more compensation following hedge fund activism while incumbent CEO pay does not significantly change. The relationship between CEO bonuses and return on assets following hedge fund activism also differs across the subsamples split by CEO turnover. Pay-performance relationship is enhanced by hedge fund activism for new CEOs, but not for incumbent CEOs. In additional analyses, we document that CEO turnover is positively associated with Tobin's Q and shareholder votes on Say on Pay in target companies after hedge fund activism.","2020-12","2025-02-06 16:37:36","2025-02-06 21:08:28","","1","","6","39","","","","","","","","","","English","","","ABI/INFORM Collection; International Bibliography of the Social Sciences (IBSS); PAIS Index","2503462445","","","Place: New York Publisher: Elsevier Sequoia S.A.","","","https://libkey.io/libraries/3027/openurl?ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&ctx_enc=info:ofi/enc:UTF-8&rfr_id=info:sid/ProQuest&rft_val_fmt=journal&rft.genre=article&rft.jtitle=Journal+of+Accounting+and+Public+Policy&rft.atitle=Hedge+fund+activism%2C+CEO+turnover+and+compensation+%E2%98%86&rft.au=Choi%2C+Wonik%3BGong%2C+James+Jianxin.&rft.aulast=Choi&rft.aufirst=Wonik&rft.date=2020-11-01&rft.volume=39&rft.issue=6&rft.spage=1&rft.isbn=&rft.btitle=&rft.title=Journal+of+Accounting+and+Public+Policy&rft.issn=02784254&rft_id=info:doi/10.1016%2Fj.jaccpubpol.2020.106774","52394:Portfolio Management and Investment Advice; Activism; Activists; Bonus systems; Business And Economics--Public Finance, Taxation; Chief executive officer; Chief executive officers; Chief executives; Companies; Compensation; Employee turnover; Executive compensation; Executives (Business); Governance; Hedge fund; Hedge funds; Pay for performance; Shareholder voting","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The sample consists of 200 South Asian health care firms over the period 2010 to 2018. After confirming the prevalence of endogeneity, we rely on the results of system generalized method of moments (GMM) rather than any static model. The results show that a higher representation of women on the board can mitigate the firm’s equity volatility. The findings of the study also purport that CEOs with higher pay–performance sensitivity exploit female directors to take the excessive risk, whereas institutional investors support the risk-averse behavior of these directors. However, we find no statistical evidence that CSR activities moderate the relationship between gender diversity and firm’s equity volatility. Our results theoretically support both stakeholder and agency perspectives that South Asian capital markets should enhance the representation of women on board to mitigate agency conflicts and to improve long-term firm’s sustainability.","2020-10","2025-02-06 16:37:36","2025-02-06 21:08:31","","","","4","10","","","","","","","","","","English","","","Publicly Available Content Database","2473726809","","","Place: Thousand Oaks Publisher: SAGE PUBLICATIONS, INC.","","; ","https://libkey.io/libraries/3027/openurl?ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&ctx_enc=info:ofi/enc:UTF-8&rfr_id=info:sid/ProQuest&rft_val_fmt=journal&rft.genre=article&rft.jtitle=Sage+Open&rft.atitle=Restrictive+and+Supportive+Mechanisms+for+Female+Directors%26rsquo%3B+Risk-Averse+Behavior%3A+Evidence+From+South+Asian+Health+Care+Industry&rft.au=Farzan%2C+Yahya%3BAbbas+Ghulam%3BAmmar%2C+Ahmed%3BHashmi%2C+Muhammad+Sadiq.&rft.aulast=Farzan&rft.aufirst=Yahya&rft.date=2020-10-01&rft.volume=10&rft.issue=4&rft.spage=&rft.isbn=&rft.btitle=&rft.title=Sage+Open&rft.issn=&rft_id=info:doi/10.1177%2F2158244020962777; https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/2158244020962777","Chief executive officers; Corporate social responsibility; CSR; Director; equity volatility; GARCH; gender diversity; Gender diversity; Generalized method of moments; institutional activism; pay–performance sensitivity; Risk averse; Social responsibility; Social Sciences: Comprehensive Works; Volatility","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Despite a strong culture, the open nature of the community presents challenges for cultural assimilation. Central contributors who make up the community’s core engage in activism to combat traditional forms of bias. However, peripheral contributors may not adopt or adhere to the community’s cultural values and may reflect the very bias the community attempts to combat. These differences create tensions between central and peripheral contributors. Peripheral contributors are likely to contribute traditional types of information bias (e.g., bias against women). In response, central contributors may overcorrect in ways that reverse traditional biases. We compare gender bias on female and male CEO profiles and find evidence of bias that advantages women and disadvantages men. While peripheral contributors may dominate early in the life cycle of core-periphery structured open collaboration communities—due to the volume of contributions—the core dominates in the long term through sustained, systematic activism. Our results suggest that a balance of activity from central and peripheral contributors results in content with the most neutral point of view.","2020-10","2025-02-06 16:37:36","2025-02-06 21:08:34","","1047-1072","","4","37","","","","","","","","","","English","","","ABI/INFORM Collection; International Bibliography of the Social Sciences (IBSS); Sociological Abstracts","2468397522","","","Place: Abingdon Publisher: Taylor & Francis Ltd.","","","https://libkey.io/libraries/3027/openurl?ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&ctx_enc=info:ofi/enc:UTF-8&rfr_id=info:sid/ProQuest&rft_val_fmt=journal&rft.genre=article&rft.jtitle=Journal+of+Management+Information+Systems&rft.atitle=The+Gender+Bias+Tug-of-War+in+a+Co-creation+Community%3A+Core-Periphery+Tension+on+Wikipedia%3A+JMIS&rft.au=Young%2C+Amber+G%3BWigdor%2C+Ariel+D%3BKane%2C+Gerald+C.&rft.aulast=Young&rft.aufirst=Amber&rft.date=2020-10-01&rft.volume=37&rft.issue=4&rft.spage=1047&rft.isbn=&rft.btitle=&rft.title=Journal+of+Management+Information+Systems&rft.issn=07421222&rft_id=info:doi/10.1080%2F07421222.2020.1831773","A pillars; Activism; Assimilation; Bias; Center and periphery; CEO; Co-creation; Community; Core peripheries; core-periphery structure; Creation; Cultural value; Cultural values; Culture; digital co-production; digital collaboration; Encyclopedias; gender bias; Gender bias; Gender differences; Human bias; Information bias; Information sources; Internet; knowledge co-creation; Knowledge management; Life cycle; Men; Neutral points; Online collaboration communities; online engagement; Open collaboration; Political Science; Response bias; Sexism; Tug of war (ToW); Wikipedia; Wikipedia neutrality","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Using a comprehensive hand-collected data set, we analyze the drivers, nature, and consequences of such settlement agreements. Settlements are more likely when the activist has a credible threat to win board seats in a proxy fight and when incumbents' reputation concerns are stronger. Consistent with incomplete contracting, face-saving benefits, and private information considerations, settlements commonly do not contract directly on operational or leadership changes sought by the activist but rather on board composition changes. Settlements are accompanied by positive stock price reactions, and they are subsequently followed by changes of the type sought by activists, including CEO turnover, higher shareholder payouts, and improved operating performance. We find no evidence to support concerns that settlements enable activists to extract rents at the expense of other investors. Our analysis provides a look into the ""black box"" of activist engagements and contributes to understanding how activism brings about changes in target companies.","2020-07","2025-02-06 16:37:36","2025-02-06 21:08:24","","1","","1","137","","","","","","","","","","English","","","ABI/INFORM Collection; International Bibliography of the Social Sciences (IBSS)","2444679253","","","Place: Amsterdam Publisher: Elsevier Sequoia S.A.","","","https://libkey.io/libraries/3027/openurl?ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&ctx_enc=info:ofi/enc:UTF-8&rfr_id=info:sid/ProQuest&rft_val_fmt=journal&rft.genre=article&rft.jtitle=Journal+of+Financial+Economics&rft.atitle=Dancing+with+activists&rft.au=Bebchuk%2C+Lucian+A%3BBrav%2C+Alon%3BJiang%2C+Wei%3BKeusch%2C+Thomas.&rft.aulast=Bebchuk&rft.aufirst=Lucian&rft.date=2020-07-01&rft.volume=137&rft.issue=1&rft.spage=1&rft.isbn=&rft.btitle=&rft.title=Journal+of+Financial+Economics&rft.issn=0304405X&rft_id=info:doi/10.1016%2Fj.jfineco.2020.01.001","Activism; Activist settlements; Activists; Business And Economics; Change agents; Corporate governance; Dance; Dancing; Hedge fund activism; Leadership; Rents; Settlement; Shareholder; Stock prices; Stockholders; Studies","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Recent research suggests that CEOs' characteristics can influence their general decisions to engage with stakeholders, however, this work has yet to consider why CEOs might utilize specific stakeholder strategies. In this article, we demonstrate how CEO regulatory focus influences the nature of a firm's stakeholder strategy. Specifically, we argue that CEO prevention focus is positively associated with engagement in governance‐oriented initiatives and receptivity to governance‐oriented stakeholder activism, while CEO promotion focus is positively associated with engagement in socially‐oriented initiatives and receptivity to socially‐oriented stakeholder activism. We find strong support for our hypotheses in a sample of 374 publicly‐traded firms.Managerial summaryThe strategies a firm uses to engage with stakeholders can influence its performance, yet little is known about what makes firms focus on certain stakeholders over others. To better understand this, we examined CEO regulatory focus in a sample of large public companies. Our findings reveal that the way CEOs view decisions—either based on a sense of duty, obligations, and responsibility or as a means to achieve high ideals—influences their tendency to prioritize shareholder concerns or the concerns of a broader array of stakeholders. This suggests that executives should be aware of their own natural tendencies to inject their motivations into their firm's stakeholder strategy and consider avenues to balance their perspectives for the sake of the firm.","2020-07","2025-02-06 16:37:36","2025-02-06 21:08:31","","1305-1335","","7","41","","","","","","","","","","English","","","ABI/INFORM Collection; International Bibliography of the Social Sciences (IBSS)","2407982737","","","Place: Chicago Publisher: Wiley Periodicals Inc.","","","https://libkey.io/libraries/3027/openurl?ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&ctx_enc=info:ofi/enc:UTF-8&rfr_id=info:sid/ProQuest&rft_val_fmt=journal&rft.genre=article&rft.jtitle=Strategic+Management+Journal&rft.atitle=Serving+differently%3A+CEO+regulatory+focus+and+firm+stakeholder+strategy&rft.au=Gamache%2C+Daniel+L%3BNeville%2C+Fran%C3%A7ois%3BBundy%2C+Jonathan%3BShort%2C+Cole+E.&rft.aulast=Gamache&rft.aufirst=Daniel&rft.date=2020-07-01&rft.volume=41&rft.issue=7&rft.spage=1305&rft.isbn=&rft.btitle=&rft.title=Strategic+Management+Journal&rft.issn=01432095&rft_id=info:doi/10.1002%2Fsmj.3134","Activism; Business And Economics--Management; CEO decision-making; CEO decision‐making; Chief executive officer; Chief executives; Companies; Corporate governance; Corporate social responsibilities (CSR); corporate social responsibility; Corporate social responsibility; Decision making; Decision theory; Economic and social effects; Governance; Public company; Recent researches; Receptivity; Regulatory focus; regulatory focus theory; stakeholder strategy; Stakeholders; Strategy research; Upper echelons theories; upper echelons theory","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We argue that CEO activism influences employee perceptions of ideological misfit (IM), whereby differing political beliefs between employees and their activist CEO can impact workplace outcomes. We consider how peer group reactions, ethical climate, external needs fulfillment, and moral identity serve as boundary conditions for perceptions of PO misfit and related organizational outcomes. We also examine antecedents of CEO activism.

The ICAO initiated a new form of engagement—private meetings with independent directors to discuss governance proposals. Compared with a single investor acting alone, the ICAO has stronger incentives to engage in activism. Its dollar holdings and voting power are six times larger and predict direct access to the board and the firms it engages. Firms engaged by the ICAO are at least 58% more likely than non-engaged firms to adopt the ICAO’s governance proposals that include adoption of majority voting, say-on-pay, and specific compensation policies. Engaged firms also increase CEO incentive pay. An event study around the announcement of the ICAO’s formation shows a positive impact on value that increases in both dollar holdings and voting power.

Research on executive turnover has either focused on CEO dismissal or on group‐level top management team (TMT) departure rates, mostly ignoring individual‐level factors that would predict why non‐CEO executives exit. Here, we extend the shock perspective of the unfolding model of turnover used in organizational behavior research to show how relational and reputational shocks influence turnover at the executive level. Our sample includes over 4,000 executives from S&P 1500 firms over 11 years. We hypothesize and find that relational and reputational shocks increase the likelihood of top executive exit. We also consider the moderating influence of pay disparity on these relationships, which impacts how each type of shock influences executive turnover.Managerial SummaryReplacing top executives can be extremely costly for firms. Consequently, understanding the reasons behind top executive exit are important. We examine the effect of different types of shock on the likelihood a top executive will exit their firm. We find that both relational shocks (e.g., other members of the TMT leaving), as well as reputational shocks (e.g., litigation or shareholder activism against the firm), increase turnover. However, we find that higher status executives experience these shocks differently than lower status executives.","2019-07","2025-02-06 16:37:36","2025-02-06 21:08:28","","1151-1168","","7","40","","","","","","","","","","English","","","ABI/INFORM Collection; International Bibliography of the Social Sciences (IBSS)","2231840410","","","Place: Chicago Publisher: Wiley Periodicals Inc.","","","https://libkey.io/libraries/3027/openurl?ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&ctx_enc=info:ofi/enc:UTF-8&rfr_id=info:sid/ProQuest&rft_val_fmt=journal&rft.genre=article&rft.jtitle=Strategic+Management+Journal&rft.atitle=Go+your+own+way%3A+Exploring+the+causes+of+top+executive+turnover&rft.au=Andrus%2C+Joel+L%3BWithers%2C+Michael+C%3BCourtright%2C+Stephen+H%3BBoivie%2C+Steven.&rft.aulast=Andrus&rft.aufirst=Joel&rft.date=2019-07-01&rft.volume=40&rft.issue=7&rft.spage=1151&rft.isbn=&rft.btitle=&rft.title=Strategic+Management+Journal&rft.issn=01432095&rft_id=info:doi/10.1002%2Fsmj.3020","Behavior; Behavioral research; Business And Economics--Management; Chief executive officers; Companies; Dismissal; Executive; executive compensation; Executive compensation; executive exit; executive labor market; Executive labor markets; Executives; Human resource management; Litigation; micro foundations; Micro-foundation; Organizational behavior; Product liability; Teams; Top management; top management teams; Top management teams; Turnover","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The relocation decision and accounting irregularities discovered after the announcement raised interest from activist investors. The firm responded by enacting a “poison pill,” but control was eventually wrestled away and the CEO was replaced. Examining these events gives students insights into corporate control issues facing a major US corporation.Design/methodology/approachThis case study presents a history of the firm from its founding in 1918 through 2017, with an emphasis on key events from 2012 through 2017. These events include acquisition of a competing firm (Dollar Thrifty), relocation of corporate headquarters, accounting irregularities, restatement of financials, activist investor responses, issuance of a “poison pill,” and turnover in the CEO position.FindingsThe case is intentionally written to “tell the story” of events that relate to issues involving control of the company around the decision to relocate its corporate headquarters. The case highlights potential agency problems between management and shareholders and the market’s response to those problems.Originality/valueNo prior case study considers the topic of corporate control from the perspective of Hertz Global Holdings. This case study can be used by instructors in graduate and undergraduate courses to examine corporate control issues from a “real world” perspective.","2018","2025-02-06 16:37:36","2025-02-06 21:08:08","","1200-1209","","10","44","","","","","","","","","","English","","","ABI/INFORM Collection","2111754965","","","Place: Patrington Publisher: Emerald Group Publishing Limited","","; ","https://media.proquest.com/media/hms/PFT/1/v7eOJ?_a=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&_s=ehyiW55FYwF5W28osdV4qckhoq4%3D; https://libkey.io/libraries/3027/openurl?ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&ctx_enc=info:ofi/enc:UTF-8&rfr_id=info:sid/ProQuest&rft_val_fmt=journal&rft.genre=article&rft.jtitle=Managerial+Finance&rft.atitle=A+look+at+corporate+control%3A+the+case+of+Hertz+Global+Holdings&rft.au=Jones%2C+Travis+L%3BAllen%2C+Marcus+T.&rft.aulast=Jones&rft.aufirst=Travis&rft.date=2018-10-01&rft.volume=44&rft.issue=10&rft.spage=1200&rft.isbn=&rft.btitle=&rft.title=Managerial+Finance&rft.issn=03074358&rft_id=info:doi/10.1108%2FMF-11-2017-0454","48811:Airport Operations; 52321:Securities and Commodity Exchanges; 53211:Passenger Car Rental and Leasing; 92111:Executive Offices; Accounting; Acquisition; Activist investors; Airports; Annual reports; Automobile rentals; Business And Economics--Management; Case studies; Chicago Illinois; Corporate control; Corporate governance; Corporate headquarters; Corporate reorganization; Corporation; Customers; Earnings per share; Employees; Financial restatements; Florida; Frissora, Mark P; Headquarter relocation; Hiring; Holding; Icahn, Carl C; Investments; New York; Presidents; Regulatory approval; Relocation; Restatement of financials; Stock exchanges; Stock prices; Tax refunds; Tenure; United States--US","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We find that the number of blocks that a firm's large institutions hold is positively associated with forced chief executive officer (CEO) turnover-performance sensitivity, abnormal returns around forced CEO turnover announcements and 13D filings, and changes in firm value. These results are particularly evident when institutions have multiple blockholdings in the same industry, when they have activism experience, or when they have long-term blockholdings in their portfolio firms. Our results suggest that information advantages and governance experience obtained from multiple blockholdings are important channels through which institutions perform effective monitoring.","2018-06","2025-02-06 16:37:36","2025-02-06 21:08:19","","576","","3","128","","","","","","","","","","English","","","ABI/INFORM Collection; International Bibliography of the Social Sciences (IBSS)","2084459893","","","Place: Amsterdam Publisher: Elsevier Sequoia S.A.","","","https://libkey.io/libraries/3027/openurl?ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&ctx_enc=info:ofi/enc:UTF-8&rfr_id=info:sid/ProQuest&rft_val_fmt=journal&rft.genre=article&rft.jtitle=Journal+of+Financial+Economics&rft.atitle=Are+institutional+investors+with+multiple+blockholdings+effective+monitors%3F&rft.au=Kang%2C+Jun-Koo%3BLuo%2C+Juan%3BNa%2C+Hyun+Seung.&rft.aulast=Kang&rft.aufirst=Jun-Koo&rft.date=2018-06-01&rft.volume=128&rft.issue=3&rft.spage=576&rft.isbn=&rft.btitle=&rft.title=Journal+of+Financial+Economics&rft.issn=0304405X&rft_id=info:doi/","Business And Economics; Chief executive officers; Corporate governance; Experience; Governance; Institutional investments; Institutional investor; Institutional investors; Monitoring; Monitoring systems; Multiple blockholdings; Studies","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Activist investors are extraorganizational stakeholders who, when dissatisfied with some aspect of the way the firm is being managed, seek to change the strategy or operations of the firm. Although some have argued that women will be viewed more favorably than men in top leadership positions (so-called ""female leadership"" advantage logic), we build on role congruity theory to hypothesize that female CEOs are significantly more likely than male CEOs to come under threat from activist investors. Results support our predictions, suggesting that female CEOs may face additional challenges not faced by male CEOs. Practical implications and directions for future research are discussed.

The guidelines found in Habermas’s “ideal speech situation” (ISS) are essential to guarantee this notion of human dignity. Based on aspects of Habermas’s (ISS), as well as Rainer Forst’s theory of justice, this study analyzes efforts made by the late speaker of Deutsche Bank, Dr. Alfred Herrhausen, and the former CEO of Alcoa and United States Secretary of the Treasury, Paul H. O’Neill, to challenge the way debt crises in the developing world were handled. Both leaders understood indebted countries, the livelihoods and dignity of its citizens, not as an external entity but as an integral part of their agendas. The two agents included underrepresented groups in their considerations and discussions through a proxy or surrogate participation, giving them a greater voice and acknowledging their dignity.","2017-11","2025-02-06 16:37:36","2025-02-06 21:08:18","","125-133","","1","146","","","","","","","","","","English","","","ABI/INFORM Collection; International Bibliography of the Social Sciences (IBSS); PAIS Index; ProQuest One Psychology","1963176064","","","Place: Dordrecht Publisher: Springer Nature B.V.","","; ","https://media.proquest.com/media/hms/PFT/1/fV7M3?_a=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%2BgIBToIDA1dlYooDHENJRDoyMDI1MDIwNjE2MDgzMzEzOToxMTg1MDM%3D&_s=OumGZINmrt%2FGgkzgrou%2FQsxZrX4%3D; https://libkey.io/libraries/3027/openurl?ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&ctx_enc=info:ofi/enc:UTF-8&rfr_id=info:sid/ProQuest&rft_val_fmt=journal&rft.genre=article&rft.jtitle=Journal+of+Business+Ethics&rft.atitle=Aligning+Civic+and+Corporate+Leadership+with+Human+Dignity%3A+Activism+at+the+Intersection+of+Business+and+Government%3A+JBE&rft.au=Kipper%2C+Knut.&rft.aulast=Kipper&rft.aufirst=Knut&rft.date=2017-11-01&rft.volume=146&rft.issue=1&rft.spage=125&rft.isbn=&rft.btitle=&rft.title=Journal+of+Business+Ethics&rft.issn=01674544&rft_id=info:doi/10.1007%2Fs10551-015-2917-5","Activism; Alfred Herrhausen; Business ethics; Crises; Debt; Developing countries--LDCs; Dignity; Discourse ethics; Economic crisis; Ethics; Habermas, Jurgen; Human dignity; Ideal speech situation (ISS); Jürgen Habermas; Justice; Justification; Law; Leadership; Matthias Kettner; Paul H.

We also examine how this association is affected by CEO power and three agency risk factors present in the firm, namely size, leverage, and performance. We find that greater cash in the compensation structure is negatively associated with the likelihood of actual earnings beating forecasted earnings by a large margin. In addition, we find that this negative association is modestly weaker in firms managed by a powerful CEO and stronger in firms that are exposed to more agency risks. Findings generally suggest compensation plans comprised predominantly of cash may promote objective financial reporting oversight performed by the audit committee and more specifically when CEOs are less powerful and need for monitoring is heightened. Our results have implications for investors, directors, regulators, governance activists, and future researchers.","2017-11","2025-02-06 16:37:36","2025-02-06 21:08:20","","304-323","","3","21","","","","","","","","","","English","","","ABI/INFORM Collection; International Bibliography of the Social Sciences (IBSS)","1948357605","","","Place: Oxford Publisher: Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","","","https://libkey.io/libraries/3027/openurl?ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&ctx_enc=info:ofi/enc:UTF-8&rfr_id=info:sid/ProQuest&rft_val_fmt=journal&rft.genre=article&rft.jtitle=International+Journal+of+Auditing&rft.atitle=Audit+committee+cash+compensation+and+propensity+of+firms+to+beat+earnings+by+a+large+margin%3A+Conditional+effects+of+CEO+power+and+agency+risks&rft.au=Rickling%2C+Maria+F%3BSharma%2C+Divesh+S.&rft.aulast=Rickling&rft.aufirst=Maria&rft.date=2017-11-01&rft.volume=21&rft.issue=3&rft.spage=304&rft.isbn=&rft.btitle=&rft.title=International+Journal+of+Auditing&rft.issn=10906738&rft_id=info:doi/10.1111%2Fijau.12098","Agency; analyst forecast; Audit; audit committee; Audit committee; Audit committees; Audits; Boards of directors; Business And Economics--Accounting; cash; CEO power; Chief executive officers; Chief executives; Companies; compensation; Compensation; Compensation plans; corporate governance; Earnings; earnings management; Earnings management; Financial reporting; Governance; Leverage; managerial hegemony; Power; Risk factors","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Additionally, we found that any source of CEO power, whether informal or formal, is a good catalyst for transforming shareholder activism into corporate greening.

We argue that CSO is a legitimacy signal consciously employed by firms to demonstrate their shareholder and specific non-shareholder orientations in the midst of institutional pressures emerging from country and industry contexts. Using a 7-code index of CSO on CEO-shareholder communications from India, we find that in general large firms in India exhibit a pre-dominant, significant and rising trend of pro-shareholder orientation in the six-year period immediately preceding the CSR law. Yet, we uncover significant industry differences in CSO potentially driven by four key factors: the degree of competitive dynamics, nature of products and services, extent of negative externalities and social activism, and exposure to international markets. Our findings support the view that while some minimum threshold of regulatory intervention is required to balance the interests of business with society, legislation raises questions in relation to the usefulness of a uniform one-size-fits-all CSR across all industries.","2017-07","2025-02-06 16:37:36","2025-02-06 21:08:24","","701-719","","4","143","","","","","","","","","","English","","","ABI/INFORM Collection; International Bibliography of the Social Sciences (IBSS); PAIS Index; ProQuest One Psychology","1917626786","","","Place: Dordrecht Publisher: Springer Nature B.V.","","; ","https://media.proquest.com/media/hms/PFT/1/7Hzz1?_a=ChgyMDI1MDIwNjE2MTUwMDU2NTo5NDExNTcSBjEwMjEyNhoKT05FX1NFQVJDSCIPMTI4LjE3OS4xNTQuMjQzKgQ2NDcyMgoxOTE3NjI2Nzg2Og1Eb2N1bWVudEltYWdlQgEwUgZPbmxpbmVaAkZUYgNQRlRqCjIwMTcvMDcvMDFyCjIwMTcvMDcvMzF6AIIBKVAtMTAxMDEyOS0xMjAwNi1DVVNUT01FUi0xMDAwMDM4Ny03MjI0NjM3kgEGT25saW5lygF1TW96aWxsYS81LjAgKE1hY2ludG9zaDsgSW50ZWwgTWFjIE9TIFggMTBfMTVfNykgQXBwbGVXZWJLaXQvNTM3LjM2IChLSFRNTCwgbGlrZSBHZWNrbykgQ2hyb21lLzEzMS4wLjAuMCBTYWZhcmkvNTM3LjM20gESU2Nob2xhcmx5IEpvdXJuYWxzmgIHUHJlUGFpZKoCK09TOkVNUy1NZWRpYUxpbmtzU2VydmljZS1nZXRNZWRpYVVybEZvckl0ZW3KAg9BcnRpY2xlfEZlYXR1cmXSAgFZ8gIA%2BgIBToIDA1dlYooDHENJRDoyMDI1MDIwNjE2MDgzMzEzOToxMTg1MDM%3D&_s=58wdF%2BwKcKdry%2Bvyd3X3cNIHjLg%3D; https://libkey.io/libraries/3027/openurl?ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&ctx_enc=info:ofi/enc:UTF-8&rfr_id=info:sid/ProQuest&rft_val_fmt=journal&rft.genre=article&rft.jtitle=Journal+of+Business+Ethics&rft.atitle=Corporate+Stakeholder+Orientation+in+an+Emerging+Country+Context%3A+A+Longitudinal+Cross+Industry+Analysis%3A+JBE&rft.au=Jain%2C+Tanusree%3BAguilera%2C+Ruth+V%3BJamali%2C+Dima.&rft.aulast=Jain&rft.aufirst=Tanusree&rft.date=2017-07-01&rft.volume=143&rft.issue=4&rft.spage=701&rft.isbn=&rft.btitle=&rft.title=Journal+of+Business+Ethics&rft.issn=01674544&rft_id=info:doi/10.1007%2Fs10551-016-3074-1","Activism; Business; Business ethics; Corporate governance; Corporate responsibility; Corporate social responsibility (CSR); Corporate stakeholder orientation (CSO); Corporation; Emerging country; Emerging market; Emerging markets; Externality; India; Industry CSR; Institutional theory; International markets; Intervention; Law; Legislation; Legitimacy; Longitudinal studies; Mandatory CSR; Markets; Organizational behavior; Services; Social responsibility; Stakeholders; Stockholders; Usefulness","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We argue that top corporate managers' use of language that is congruent with a prevailing norm leads the boards of directors to evaluate the managers more favourably and to grant a higher level of compensation. We test this argument by analysing the letters to shareholders from 334 US firms and examine the CEOs' expression of the shareholder value principle, which is a prevailing model of corporate governance in the USA. We found that the use of shareholder-value language is significantly related to a higher level of CEO compensation and that the effect of shareholder-value language is greater when shareholder activism is stronger.

Ellison was the best-paid CEO, earning $96.2 million as total annual compensation. He has received $1.8 billion over the 1993â-""2012 time period. The lowest-paid on the same list is General Motorsâ-(TM) D.F. Akerson, who earned $11.1 million. The average national pay for a non-supervisory U.S. worker was $51,200 in 2012, meaning that the average of the top CEOs made 354 times more than the average non-supervisory worker in 2012. Hunter Harrison, Canadian Pacific Railway Ltd., was the best-paid CEO in Canada for 2012 and received CDN $49.2 million in total annual compensation, significantly higher than Canadaâ-(TM)s best-paid CEO in 2011, Magnaâ-(TM)s F. Stronach, who received CDN $40.9 million. In 2011, the average Canadian annual salary was CDN $45,488 and Canadaâ-(TM)s top fifty CEOs earned 235 times more than the average Canadian worker. These executive pay practices contrast with the growing inequality in Canada, recently illustrated with the finding that 40% of Indigenous children live in poverty. In contrast, Japanâ-(TM)s highest-paid CEO is Nissan Motor Co.â-(TM)s Carlos Ghosn, who earned 988 million yen ($10.1 million) in the year ending March 2013, barely changed from the previous year and only modestly improved from his US $9.5 million compensation in 2009. That does not even put him among the top 200 most highly paid U.S. company chiefs and the top twenty best-paid CEOs in Canada for 2012. Why are Japanese CEOs paid considerably less than their American or Canadian counterparts? This Article argues that the activism of long-term-oriented institutional investors such as banks and the tying of executive pay to worker welfare in the context of a culture of intolerance towards excessive executive compensation explain to a great extent the development of a pattern of low executive pay in Japan, despite the recent weakening of bank monitoring as a result of the adoption of a U.S. style of governance in some Japanese companies. The Japanese experience also demonstrates that lower executive compensation does not compromise firm performance and is a necessary condition to building a stakeholder-friendly corporation. For example, the CEO of Toyota (the worldâ-(TM)s biggest automaker), Akio Toyoda, earned 184 million yen ($1.9 million) in 2012, a 35% increase from the previous year. He is the lowest-paid chief of the worldâ-(TM)s five biggest automakers, and led Toyota to generate the highest return in 2012 among the top five global automakers. Toyotaâ-(TM)s outlook for increasing profit prompted the automaker to approve the biggest bonus for workers in recent years. By contrast, Alan Mulally, Ford Motor Co.â-(TM)s chief and the best paid among the top five, took home $21 million in 2012.","2016","2025-02-06 16:37:36","2025-02-06 21:08:38","","721","","3","64","","","","","","","","","","English","","","International Bibliography of the Social Sciences (IBSS); PAIS Index","1844558605","","","Place: Oxford Publisher: American Society of Comparative Law","","","https://libkey.io/libraries/3027/openurl?ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&ctx_enc=info:ofi/enc:UTF-8&rfr_id=info:sid/ProQuest&rft_val_fmt=journal&rft.genre=article&rft.jtitle=American+Journal+of+Comparative+Law&rft.atitle=Why+Does+Executive+Greed+Prevail+in+the+United+States+and+Canada+but+Not+in+Japan%3F+The+Pattern+of+Low+CEO+Pay+and+High+Worker+Welfare+in+Japanese+Corporations&rft.au=Salazar%2C+Alberto+R%3BRaggiunti%2C+John.&rft.aulast=Salazar&rft.aufirst=Alberto&rft.date=2016-10-01&rft.volume=64&rft.issue=3&rft.spage=721&rft.isbn=&rft.btitle=&rft.title=American+Journal+of+Comparative+Law&rft.issn=0002919X&rft_id=info:doi/","Activism; Averages; Banking; Canada; Chief executives; Companies; Compensation; Compromises; Executives (Business); Governance; Greed; Indigenous peoples; Inequality; Institutional investments; Investors; Japan; Law--International Law; Meaning; Organizational performance; Poverty; Public policy; United States--US; Welfare","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Design/methodology/approach – A quantitative survey was conducted among top executives of listed and private companies operating in the largest European country, Germany (n=602). Findings – The study identifies a traditional mindset: top executives focus on primary stakeholders (customers, employees) instead of secondary stakeholders (politicians, activists), they value mass media higher than social media, and they rate speaking more important than listening. Moreover, communication professionals are not always the first choice when CEOs and board members reflect on the topics at hand. Advanced visions of strategic communication developed in academia and practice have not yet arrived in many boardrooms. Research limitations/implications – The sample is not representative for all CEOs in corporations and it is limited to one country. Originality/value – While the performance of corporate communications depends heavily on the perceptions, beliefs, and expectations that top executives hold towards communication and its contribution to organizational goal, little is known about this. Most knowledge is based on qualitative interviews and small-scale samples. This study provides an overview of previous insights and takes a broader empirical approach.","2015","2025-02-06 16:37:37","2025-02-06 21:08:24","","291-309","","3","20","","","","","","","","","","English","","","ABI/INFORM Collection; ProQuest One Psychology","2083735050","","","Place: Bradford Publisher: Emerald Group Publishing Limited","","; ","https://media.proquest.com/media/hms/PFT/1/HIPc6?_a=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&_s=qFoUsNTeyIcJl3FhmUwDWaJay0o%3D; https://libkey.io/libraries/3027/openurl?ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&ctx_enc=info:ofi/enc:UTF-8&rfr_id=info:sid/ProQuest&rft_val_fmt=journal&rft.genre=article&rft.jtitle=Corporate+Communications&rft.atitle=Corporate+communications+from+the+CEO%26rsquo%3Bs+perspective&rft.au=Zerfass%2C+Ansgar%3BSherzada%2C+Muschda.&rft.aulast=Zerfass&rft.aufirst=Ansgar&rft.date=2015-07-01&rft.volume=20&rft.issue=3&rft.spage=291&rft.isbn=&rft.btitle=&rft.title=Corporate+Communications&rft.issn=13563289&rft_id=info:doi/10.1108%2FCCIJ-04-2014-0020","Business And Economics--Management; Business communications; Chief executive officer; Chief executive officers; Communication; Corporate communication; Corporate communications; Corporation; Digital media; Germany; Institutional theory; Institutionalism; Interviews; Neo-institutionalism; Objectives of corporate communications; Principal-agent-relationships; Professionals; Public opinion; Public relations; Qualitative research; Reputations; Research; Responsibilities; Role of communication professionals; Society; Stakeholders; Strategic communication; Success; Surveys & questionnaires","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Using the exogenous shock of the 1989 Canada-United States Free Trade Agreement, we find that duality firms outperform non-duality firms by 3-4% when their competitive environments change. Further, the performance difference is larger for firms with higher information costs and better corporate governance. Our results underscore the benefits of CEO duality in saving information costs and making speedy decisions.

Building on and extending the insights from political theories of organizations, this paper explores how the historical shift from managerial to investor capitalism has reshaped firm-level power dynamics over executive succession, contributing to the rise of outsider succession. Three developments were particularly crucial-the growth of institutional ownership, the strengthening of internal monitoring by the board, and the rise of shareholder activism. Using data on the complete histories of CEO succession at 686 large U.S. corporations between 1981 and 2005, this article shows how these new developments have pluralized firm-level power struggles over executive succession and thus have further politicized the process. The importance of firm-level power dynamics in the process suggests that a shift in the dominant institutional logic does not directly translate into a new corporate practice, but that such translation depends on the outcome of firm-level power dynamics.

Using resource dependency theory as our conceptual framing, we identify some of the drivers of corporate responses to shareholder activists. This study departs from previous studies by including a fourth possible corporate response, engaging in dialogue. Dialogue, an alternative to shareholder resolutions filed by activists, is a process in which corporations and activist shareholder groups mutually agree to engage in ongoing negotiations to deal with social issues. Based on a unique dataset of resolutions filed by member organizations of the Interfaith Center on Corporate Responsibility from 2002 to 2005 and the outcomes of these resolutions, our analysis finds that corporate managers are more likely to engage in dialogue with shareholder activists when the firm is larger, is more responsive to stakeholders, the CEO is the board chair, and the firm has a relatively lower percentage of institutional investors.

One year after the acquisition of the major Dutch financial conglomerate ABN AMRO, the global financial crisis caused the collapse of the Fortis group. The purpose of this article is to use the case study of Fortis's recent fall as a basis for reflective considerations on the financial crisis, from stakeholder and ethical perspectives. A selected number of key events of the history of the dramatic crisis at Fortis will be analysed from different ethical frameworks. Special consideration will be given to fairness of communication, shareholder activism and conflicts of interests of CEO's mergers opportunities. A confrontation between the CSR policy and the reality raises the fundamental questions why the powerful CSR guidelines and ethical principles did not help in the assessment of the risks.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]","2011-08","2025-02-06 16:37:37","2025-02-06 21:08:33","","169-191","","2","102","","","","","","","","","","English","","","ABI/INFORM Collection; International Bibliography of the Social Sciences (IBSS); PAIS Index; ProQuest One Psychology","883904644","","","Place: Dordrecht Publisher: Springer Nature B.V.","","; ","https://media.proquest.com/media/hms/OBJ/9dgMU?_a=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%3D%3D&_s=%2Bg91%2F%2F2XpHY%2B2eXJU30uuk8eeiU%3D; https://libkey.io/libraries/3027/openurl?ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&ctx_enc=info:ofi/enc:UTF-8&rfr_id=info:sid/ProQuest&rft_val_fmt=journal&rft.genre=article&rft.jtitle=Journal+of+Business+Ethics&rft.atitle=The+Collapse+of+a+European+Bank+in+the+Financial+Crisis%3A+An+Analysis+from+Stakeholder+and+Ethical+Perspectives%3A+JBE&rft.au=Fassin%2C+Yves%3BGosselin%2C+Derrick.&rft.aulast=Fassin&rft.aufirst=Yves&rft.date=2011-08-01&rft.volume=102&rft.issue=2&rft.spage=169&rft.isbn=&rft.btitle=&rft.title=Journal+of+Business+Ethics&rft.issn=01674544&rft_id=info:doi/10.1007%2Fs10551-011-0812-2","Accountability; Annual reports; Bank; Bank acquisitions & mergers; Bankruptcy; Business ethics; Case studies; Case study; Communication; Corporate governance; Corporate social responsibility; Data collection; Economic crisis; Economics; European Central Bank; Financial crisis; Insurance companies; International finance; Law; Leadership; Qualitative research; Research methodology; Shareholder activism; Social responsibility; Stakeholders; Stockholders; Success","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Others claim that CEOs strategically choose CSR activities to reduce the probability of CEO turnover in a future period through indirect support from activists. Still others assert that firms use CSR activities to signal their product quality. We find that firms use governance mechanisms, along with CSR engagement, to reduce conflicts of interest between managers and non-investing stakeholders. Employing a large and extensive sample of firms within Russell 2000, S&500 and Domini 400 indices during the 1993-2004 period, we find that consistent with the conflict-resolution hypothesis, the CSR choice is positively associated with governance characteristics, including board independence, institutional ownership, and analyst following. In addition, after correcting for endogeneity of CSR engagement, our results show that CSR engagement positively influences operating performance and firm value, supporting the conflict-resolution hypothesis as opposed to the over-investment and strategic-choice arguments. We find only a weak support of the product-signaling hypothesis as a major motive of CSR engagement.

We find that when the House passed the Say-on-Pay Bill, the market reaction was significantly positive for firms with high abnormal chief executive officer (CEO) compensation, with low pay-for-performance sensitivity, and responsive to shareholder pressure. However, activist-sponsored say-on-pay proposals target large firms, not those with excessive CEO pay, poor governance, or poor performance. The market reacts negatively to labor-sponsored proposal announcements and positively when these proposals are defeated. Our findings suggest that say-on-pay creates value for companies with inefficient compensation but can destroy value for others.","2011-04","2025-02-06 16:37:37","2025-02-06 21:08:32","","299-339","","2","46","","","","","","","","","","English","","","ABI/INFORM Collection; International Bibliography of the Social Sciences (IBSS)","2779402104","","","Place: Seattle Publisher: Cambridge University Press","","; ","https://media.proquest.com/media/hms/PFT/1/bpDmQ?_a=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&_s=D3QbBITBH31Krpam7wLNZnp2%2B0I%3D; https://libkey.io/libraries/3027/openurl?ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&ctx_enc=info:ofi/enc:UTF-8&rfr_id=info:sid/ProQuest&rft_val_fmt=journal&rft.genre=article&rft.jtitle=Journal+of+Financial+and+Quantitative+Analysis&rft.atitle=Shareholders%26rsquo%3B+Say+on+Pay%3A+Does+It+Create+Value%3F&rft.au=.&rft.aulast=&rft.aufirst=&rft.date=2011-04-01&rft.volume=46&rft.issue=2&rft.spage=299&rft.isbn=&rft.btitle=&rft.title=Journal+of+Financial+and+Quantitative+Analysis&rft.issn=00221090&rft_id=info:doi/10.1017%2FS0022109010000803","Accountability; Activists; Business And Economics--Banking And Finance; Compensation; Executive compensation; Governance; Low pay; Pay for performance; Performance related pay; Shareholder; Stockholders","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Union pension funds sponsor most of these initiatives, yet their targeting criteria do not appear to reflect labor-related motives. Shareholders favor proposals related to the pay-setting process (e.g., subject severance pay to shareholder approval) over proposals that micromanage pay level or structure. While activists target firms with high CEO pay (whether excessive or not), voting support is higher only at firms with excess CEO pay. Firms with excess CEO pay targeted by vote-no campaigns experience a significant reduction in CEO pay ($7.3 million). Our findings contribute to the debate on ""say on pay"" and other reforms empowering shareholders.

Proposal submissions in Europe remain infrequent compared to the USA, especially in Continental Europe. In the UK proposals typically relate to a proxy contest seeking board changes, while in Continental Europe they are more focused on specific governance issues. There is some evidence that proposal sponsors are valuable monitors, because the target firms tend to underperform and have low leverage. Sponsors also consider the ownership structure of the firm, because proposal probability increases in the target's ownership concentration and the equity stake of institutional investors. While proposals enjoy limited voting success across Europe, they are relatively more successful in the UK. The outcomes are strongest for proposals targeting the board but are also affected by the target characteristics including the CEO's pay-performance sensitivity. Proposals are met with a significant negative abnormal return of -1.23 percent, when they are voted upon at general meetings. The low voting support gathered by proposals and the strongly adverse market reaction suggest that shareholders of European companies use proposals as an emergency brake rather than a steering wheel.

The context of the study is the Directors' Remuneration Report (DRR) Regulations of 2002. This legislation gave shareholders a mandatory non-binding vote on boardroom pay in the UK.Research Findings/Insights: First, we find that less than 10 per cent of shareholders abstain or vote against the mandated Directors' Remuneration Report (DRR) resolution. This percentage is falling over time. Second, investors are more likely to vote against DRR resolutions compared to non-pay resolutions. Third, shareholders are more likely to vote against general executive pay resolutions, such as stock options, long-term incentive plans, and bonus resolutions compared to non-pay resolutions. Forth, firms with higher CEO pay attract greater voting dissent. Fifth, there is little evidence that CEO pay is lower in firms that previously experienced high levels of shareholder dissent. In addition, there is little evidence that the fraction of CEO equity pay, representing owner-manager alignment, is greater in such firms. Currently, we find limited evidence that, on average, 'say on pay' materially alters the subsequent level and design of CEO compensation.Theoretical/Academic Implications: pay. Theoretically, shareholder voting is endogenously determined.Practitioner/Policy Implications: The study provides insights for practitioners and policy makers interested in shareholder rights, the effects on corporate governance, and say on pay in the UK. Shareholder voting appears to have limited effects on curbing excess CEO pay. Boards and compensation committees may want to communicate better policies on executive compensation to avert shareholder dissent.

The results for CEO equity incentives are similar. We also find that as the presence of institutional ownership siding with management (banks and insurance companies) increases relative to voice activists, the use of equity incentives at middle managerial levels declines. Results for CEO equity incentives are not the same.Theoretical/Academic Implications: find evidence of differing governance mechanisms used by voice activists (e.g., public pension funds) and exit activists (e.g., large shareholders). Voice activists face a higher cost of monitoring managers as compared to exit activists, and thus they will advocate for the heavier use of equity incentive compensation at the middle managerial level. In agreement with a managerial power perspective, however, we also find the use of equity incentives for middle managers decreases as the proportion of institutional ownership siding with the CEO increases.Practitioner/Policy Implications: Shareholder activism plays a key role in aligning managerial interests below the CEO level; however, different types of shareholders have different economic and political interests in how equity compensation is shaped to achieve this. Exit activists use monitoring and voice activists substitute equity compensation for monitoring. Shareholders siding with management may also reduce the use of equity incentives for middle managers. These differing interests should be considered in crafting policy responses.

The case perspective is that of the CEO of Degussa AG, a multispecialty chemical company, headquartered in Düsseldorf, Germany. Degussa is considering whether to submit a bid to supply its anti-graffiti coating, Protectosil  ®  , for a new Memorial to the Murdered Jews in Europe being planned for Berlin. Degussa's ethical dilemma is that a former Degussa subsidiary, Degesch, manufactured and supplied the Zyklon B nerve gas used by the Nazis to kill Jews in the concentration camps during World War II. Although Degussa has made attempts both to acknowledge and to atone for its war-time Nazi collaboration, public disclosure of its bid has the potential to engulf Degussa in controversy when activists and Jewish leaders learn of it. Students are asked to evaluate the bid's benefits and costs to Degussa's stakeholders, to consider the relevance of a company's historical legacy to contemporary decision making, and to explore how German corporate history during and after the Holocaust has parallels to human rights issues in other countries.

Probit analysis using an unbalanced panel of the top 460 UK listed companies from 1990 to 1998 was employed. No evidence of effective board monitoring was found. On the other hand, evidence of institutional shareholder activism was found. In particular, when institutional concentration is high, the turnover-performance link is more negative in relation to stock returns but less negative in relation to accounting performance. This is consistent with institutional investors using a richer set of information than that contained in reported accounting earnings. Further research may examine the effect of board monitoring on the turnover-performance relation after considering the endogeneity of board structure and membership. Moreover, further research may examine the complementarity of the two governance mechanisms considered, i.e. the board of directors and institutional investors. In the aftermath of Enron and other corporate frauds world-wide, the paper exploits a unique dataset of institutional ownership and provides additional evidence on the controversial role of boards and institutional investors in replacing inefficient CEOs, as well as on the role of accounting information in the effectiveness of governance processes.","2008","2025-02-06 16:37:37","2025-02-06 21:08:19","","862-872","","9","23","","","","","","","","","","English","","","ABI/INFORM Collection","274701169","","","Place: Bradford Publisher: Emerald Group Publishing Limited","","; ","https://media.proquest.com/media/hms/OBJ/xmrZT?_a=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%3D%3D&_s=SPx0bLOF%2FMHD319XzyWW%2B9dpkKA%3D; https://libkey.io/libraries/3027/openurl?ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&ctx_enc=info:ofi/enc:UTF-8&rfr_id=info:sid/ProQuest&rft_val_fmt=journal&rft.genre=article&rft.jtitle=Managerial+Auditing+Journal&rft.atitle=Are+boards+and+institutional+investors+active+monitors%3F+Evidence+from+CEO+dismissal&rft.au=Florou%2C+Annita%3BPope%2C+Peter.&rft.aulast=Florou&rft.aufirst=Annita&rft.date=2008-11-20&rft.volume=23&rft.issue=9&rft.spage=862&rft.isbn=&rft.btitle=&rft.title=Managerial+Auditing+Journal&rft.issn=02686902&rft_id=info:doi/10.1108%2F02686900810908427","2120:Chief executive officers; 9130:Experimental/theoretical; 9175:Western Europe; Accounting; Annual reports; Board of directors; Boards of directors; Business And Economics--Management; Chief executive officer; Chief executive officers; Corporate governance; Directors; Equity; Executives; Firings; Institutional investments; Institutional investor; Investors; Rates of return; Research design; Return on assets; Shareholder activism; Stockholders; Studies; United Kingdom--UK","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Grundfest [1993. Just vote no: a minimalist strategy for dealing with barbarians inside the gates. Stanford Law Review 45, 857-937] argues that a substantial withheld vote motivates directors to take immediate action to avoid further embarrassment. We find a variety of supportive evidence, including operating performance improvements and abnormal disciplinary chief executive officer (CEO) turnover, indicating that such campaigns induce boards to take actions in shareholders' interests. Furthermore, abnormal turnover is robust to controlling for concurrent events and firm- and CEO-specific controls.

Target firms experience increases in payout, operating performance, and higher CEO turnover after activism.

But despite Payne's popularity, scholars and activists representing a wide variety of disciplines, from critical theory to mathematics education, have been highly critical of her work.

The social gains are based on the welfare to stake holders in the firm, whereas the private gains are based on shareholder wealth only. Active shareholders influence the contracting game with the CEO, and therefore also the size and the distribution of the surplus to be split between the shareholders and the CEO. Although the model is very simple and focussing on the creation and distribution of welfare between the shareholders and the CEO, we nonetheless identify surprising divergence between the private and social profitability of shareholder activism. Shareholder activism that is privately profitable is not necessarily socially profitable. The distributional effects of shareholder activism may dominate the efficiency effects to make shareholder activism a negative social NPV project.

Some shareholder groups prefer a non-executive director serving as board chair.  The central concern of reform activists is that joint service as CEO and board chair erodes the corporate system of checks and balances and compromises independence between directors and firm officers.  Not surprisingly, CEOs rarely share this concern.  More than 80% of large firm CEOs also serve as board chair.  They believe the joint leadership structure provides a unified focus and communicates strong leadership to the external community.  A paper focuses on the extent to which chairs who jointly serve as CEO are more, or less, independent than their separate counterparts.  The analysis leads to the conclusion that, while there may sometimes be compelling reasons for formally separating the CEO and board chair positions, to do so as a matter of policy for the purpose of institutionalizing independence between the board of directors and firm management is likely to be a misdirected effort.","1997-08","2025-02-06 16:37:38","2025-02-06 21:08:21","","11-20","","3","11","","","","","","","","","","English","","","ABI/INFORM Collection; International Bibliography of the Social Sciences (IBSS)","210528063; 01490750","","","Place: Briarcliff Manor Publisher: Academy of Management","","; ","https://media.proquest.com/media/hms/OBJ/SIcLU?_a=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%2BgIBToIDA1dlYooDHENJRDoyMDI1MDIwNjE2MDgzMzEzOToxMTg1MDM%3D&_s=H0N9Di8PDftN6Ydis6tBLgKeuNU%3D; https://libkey.io/libraries/3027/openurl?ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&ctx_enc=info:ofi/enc:UTF-8&rfr_id=info:sid/ProQuest&rft_val_fmt=journal&rft.genre=article&rft.jtitle=The+Academy+of+Management+Executive&rft.atitle=CEO+and+board+chair+roles+held+jointly+or+separately%3A+Much+ado+about+nothing%3F&rft.au=Daily%2C+Catherine+M%3BDalton%2C+Dan+R.&rft.aulast=Daily&rft.aufirst=Catherine&rft.date=1997-08-01&rft.volume=11&rft.issue=3&rft.spage=11&rft.isbn=&rft.btitle=&rft.title=The+Academy+of+Management+Executive&rft.issn=10795545&rft_id=info:doi/10.5465%2Fame.1997.9709231660","2110:Boards of directors; 2120:Chief executive officers; 2500:Organizational behavior; 52394:Portfolio Management and Investment Advice; 52511:Pension Funds; 9130:Experimental/theoretical treatment; 9190:US; Agency theory; Board; Boards of directors; Business And Economics--Management; Chairman of the board; Chairperson; Chief executive officer; Chief executive officers; Independence; Independent; Institutional investments; Institutionalisation; Leadership; Organization theory; Pension funds; Stockholders; Studies; United States--US","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Drawing on social exchange theory, the study develops and tests the argument that these CEO-directors may experience a reversal in the basis for generalized social exchange with other top managers from one of deference and support to one of independence and control.  Using data from a large sample of major US corporations over a recent 10-year period, the study shows: 1.  how CEO directors defect from the network of mutually supportive corporate leaders, 2.  how defections have diffused across organizations and over time, and 3.  how this has contributed to increased board control, as measured by changes in board structure, diversification strategy, and contingent compensation.","1997-03","2025-02-06 16:37:38","2025-02-06 21:08:25","","161-183","","1","42","","","","","","","","","","English","","","ABI/INFORM Collection; International Bibliography of the Social Sciences (IBSS); ProQuest One Psychology; Sociological Abstracts; Worldwide Political Science Abstracts","203962675; 01423699","","","Place: Thousand Oaks Publisher: SAGE PUBLICATIONS, INC.","","; ","https://media.proquest.com/media/hms/OBJ/2ucGU?_a=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&_s=7JqNFqHDO%2F0EeTjvpWIpuzI1z0A%3D; https://libkey.io/libraries/3027/openurl?ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&ctx_enc=info:ofi/enc:UTF-8&rfr_id=info:sid/ProQuest&rft_val_fmt=journal&rft.genre=article&rft.jtitle=Administrative+Science+Quarterly&rft.atitle=Defections+from+the+inner+circle%3A+Social+exchange%2C+reciprocity%2C+and+the+diffusion+of+board+independence+in+U.S.+corporations&rft.au=Westphal%2C+James+D%3BZajac%2C+Edward+J.&rft.aulast=Westphal&rft.aufirst=James&rft.date=1997-03-01&rft.volume=42&rft.issue=1&rft.spage=161&rft.isbn=&rft.btitle=&rft.title=Administrative+Science+Quarterly&rft.issn=00018392&rft_id=info:doi/","2110:Boards of directors; 2120:Chief executive officers; 2500:Organizational behavior; 9130:Experimental/theoretical treatment; 9190:US; Behavioral sciences; Boards of directors; Chief executive officer; Chief executive officers; Corporate governance; Corporation; Directors; Hypotheses; Independence; Reciprocity; Social exchange theory; Sociology; Statistical analysis; Studies; United States--US","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Despite limited empirical evidence, duality (chairman of the board and CEO are the same individual) has been blamed, in many cases, for the poor performance and failure of firms to adapt to a changing environment.  In examining the relationship between duality and firm performance, a study considers the announcement effects of changes in duality status, accounting measures of operating performance for firms that have changed their duality structure, and long-term measures of performance for firms that have had a consistent history of a duality structure.  The results suggest that: 1.  the market is indifferent to changes in a firm's duality status, 2.  there is little evidence of operating performance changes around changes in duality status, and 3.  there is only weak evidence that duality status affects long-term performance, after controlling for other factors that might affect that performance.","1996-01","2025-02-06 16:37:38","2025-02-06 21:08:21","","41","","1","17","","","","","","","","","","English","","","ABI/INFORM Collection; International Bibliography of the Social Sciences (IBSS)","225021057; 01142906","","","Place: Chicago Publisher: Wiley Periodicals Inc.","","; ","https://media.proquest.com/media/pq/classic/doc/415559611/fmt/ai/rep/NONE?_a=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&_s=SDhLsSOgOvQnVV02cL7hCfLcmu0%3D; https://libkey.io/libraries/3027/openurl?ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&ctx_enc=info:ofi/enc:UTF-8&rfr_id=info:sid/ProQuest&rft_val_fmt=journal&rft.genre=article&rft.jtitle=Strategic+Management+Journal&rft.atitle=CEO+duality+and+firm+performance%3A+What%27s+the+fuss%3F&rft.au=Baliga%2C+B+Ram%3BMoyer%2C+R+Charles%3BRao%2C+Ramesh+S.&rft.aulast=Baliga&rft.aufirst=B&rft.date=1996-01-01&rft.volume=17&rft.issue=1&rft.spage=41&rft.isbn=&rft.btitle=&rft.title=Strategic+Management+Journal&rft.issn=01432095&rft_id=info:doi/","1130:Economic theory; 2110:Boards of directors; 3400:Investment analysis; 9130:Experimental/theoretical treatment; 9190:US; Activism; Boards of directors; Business And Economics--Management; Chief executive officer; Company; Corporate governance; Critics; duality; Economic; Economic models; Environmental changes; Financial performance; governance; Hypotheses; Managers; Market shares; performance; Regression analysis; Shareholder value; Stock prices; Stockholders; Studies; United States--US","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Concentrated ownership, family control, limited institutional investors activism, and lack of main bank monitoring make Italy a corporate governance environment dominated by insiders. As a result, boards of directors are dominated by insiders and/or represent the interests of the controlling shareholders. Our main finding is that CEO turnover is negatively related to firm performance also in this environment, but this relationship holds only if the controlling shareholder is not the CEO. Our findings suggest that insiders with large stakes monitor and replace under-performing outside CEOs.

We find evidence of activist investors throughout the sample period and their impact is consistently significant in multivariate analysis. In contrast, voting with their feet has declined to the point where it no longer affects turnover outcomes. Nonetheless, activism is fairly uncommon and does not explain the higher turnover observed over time. Block holdings of known activists have increased and are linked to improving target firms.

We find that LTL is more likely in Chapter 11 firms with better operating performance, when prepetition bank lenders' stakes are at risk, or when they have prior lending relationships with the distressed borrower. In contrast, LTO is more likely in small firms or when prepetition bank lenders' loans are over-collateralized.

Since large shareholders can expropriate minority shareholders by neutralizing governance mechanisms which attempt to discipline management, we focus on the relationship between corporate governance and hedge fund activism in French listed target firms.

Many people are simply fed up with the current state of affairs and want to see people in power held accountable. As a result, CEOs are taking public stances on timely issues. They are doing so not only because they want to win favor with their employees and customers but also because they feel an obligation—and pressure—to speak up and pursue greater good on behalf of others since they have platforms and visibility that are not shared by those whose lack similar status or vehicles to for their voices to be heard. This is a qualitative study that involved in-depth interviews with 24 CEO activists. Data analysis followed the hermeneutic phenomenological approach. The findings advance the CEO activism literature by focusing on the tactical repertoire of activist CEOs within the non-Western context of Ghana. Activist CEOs in Ghana use a broader portfolio of tactics than previously thought, offer a typology of CEO activism tactics, and help to internationalize CEO activism research.

Leaders across industries have addressed the expectation by engaging in activism. While some upper echelons leaders initiate activism efforts in a way that strengthens their firms, others are struggling to do so without risking brand and business performance. This research addresses this important managerial challenge by conceptualizing activism through a risk paradigm. To do this, we first introduce and define a construct called Enterprise Activism. The construct comprises all forms of firm-initiated activism which can impact brand and business performance, such as brand activism, CEO activism, and corporate activism, regardless of who is making the decision (e.g., Chief Marketing Officer or store manager) or whether a portfolio brand or the corporate brand is involved (e.g., Harris Teeter or the corporate brand, Kroger). We then conceptualize the Enterprise Activism Risk Model, providing insight into how different types of actions can pose market share and positional advantage risks. Leveraging insight from C-level leaders, we identify ways that firm leaders can deploy the model to advance business practice. Finally, we provide a research agenda to develop new theory and evidence to help support and improve practice. The new insight provided herein provides a framework that can enable upper echelons leaders to evaluate, discuss, and navigate activism to minimize business risk.","2024-06-01","2025-02-06 20:00:27","2025-02-06 21:08:34","","330-340","","2","100","","Journal of Retailing","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Activism; Board of directors; Brand activism; CEO activism; Chief executive officers; Chief marketing officers; Corporate activism; Enterprise activism; Retail activism; Sociopolitical activism; Upper echelons leaders","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Specifically, they reduce the likelihood of financial restatements, improve CEO performance-turnover sensitivity, and improve corporate investment efficiency. Our findings are robust to propensity score matching, instrumental variable estimation and the exogenous shock of mandatory online voting. Moreover, independent directors facing dissent are more likely to vote against board proposals and to reduce their absences from board meetings. The mechanism analysis shows that shareholder dissent operates through the reputation concern and market signal channels. The effect of dissent is more prominent for non-SOEs, for firms with more high-profile directors, and for firms with less powerful CEOs.

While managerial activism is valuable in the pursuit of pro-business strategies, pro-manager agendas may exacerbate agency problems. Our evidence shows that firm performance improves with managerial activism through collective pro-business effort but is diminished by pro-manager activism. Furthermore, pro-business activism typically increases CEO compensation, whereas pro-manager activism decreases it. Firms that benefit most from collective managerial activism are those that are government dependent, have more intangible assets, or operate in industries with low competition. Overall, pro-business managerial activism adds value to firms, especially when information dissemination is more essential due to firm characteristics.","2024-06-01","2025-02-06 20:00:27","2025-02-06 21:08:30","","102588","","","86","","Journal of Corporate Finance","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Corporate governance; Corporate social responsibility; Firm performance; Lobbying; Managerial activism","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Increase in long-term institutional ownership leads to longer equity vesting periods measured by CEO pay duration. Further, CEO pay duration decreases following hedge-fund activism that is often argued to be associated with short-term investment horizon. To establish causality, we use institutional mergers as an exogenous change in institutional investor horizon, and to address reverse causality, we use the indexing behavior of institutions. We support our findings by providing evidence that long-term institutional ownership is associated with long-term oriented shareholder proposals.

Zingales [Journal of Finance 55 (2000) 1623] calls for research concerning the effects of public opinion on corporate governance. The California Public Employees' Retirement System (CalPERS) influences public opinion by publicly naming the companies having poor corporate governance. This study hypothesizes that public naming by CalPERS damages the reputations of management and directors at these companies, and these companies respond by improving their corporate governance. This hypothesis is supported by three findings. First, companies are more likely to decrease the number of inside directors after being named publicly by CalPERS. A large proportion of departing inside directors remains full-time employees in the named companies. Second, departing inside directors are less likely to take up future directorships after their companies are named publicly by CalPERS. Finally, the likelihood of CEO dismissal increases and the relation between performance and CEO dismissal becomes stronger after companies are named publicly by CalPERS. These three findings are consistent with the hypothesis that CalPERS influences public opinion and that reputation concerns are effective in compelling companies to improve their corporate governance system.","2004-01-01","2025-02-06 20:00:27","2025-02-06 21:08:35","","199-227","","1","10","","Journal of Corporate Finance","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","CalPERS; Corporate governance; Public opinion","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Chief Human Resource Officers (CHROs) have a potentially important role in defining and promoting appropriate human resource practices through human resource disclosures in corporate annual reports. We empirically examine the effect of CHROs on expanded human capital resource (HCR) disclosures, recently mandated by the SEC. We find that CHROs have a greater effect on the quality of HCR disclosures when they belong to the top management team, and less so when they belong to groups that are more poorly represented in top management, such as women, racial or ethnic minorities, or non-US nationals, and CHROs holding a liberal arts degree. Jointly considering the characteristics of CHROs, CEOs, and CFOs, we additionally find that pro-democratic political ideology is related to higher quality HCR disclosures. This study contributes to the literature by introducing a generalizable measure of HCR disclosure quality, uncovering significant heterogeneity in HCR disclosure quality across large US firms, and highlighting the role of CHROs in this process. In doing so, this study documents evidence that individual top executives in addition to the CEO and CFO can have a measurable effect on voluntary financial disclosures.","2023-05-01","2025-02-06 20:00:27","2025-02-06 21:08:23","","107083","","3","42","","Journal of Accounting and Public Policy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Despite the aggregate M&A market amounting to several trillions USD on an annual basis, acquiring firms often underperform relative to non-acquiring firms, especially in public takeovers. Although hundreds of academic studies have investigated the deal- and firm-level factors associated with M&A announcement returns, short-run returns are often not sustained in the long run. Moreover, the wide variety of performance measures and heterogeneity in sample sizes complicates the drawing of accurate and unambiguous conclusions. In this light, our survey compiles the recent literature and aims to identify the areas of research for which short-run returns predict (or fail to predict) long-run performance.

The secondary sources included news reports, industry reports, company websites, annual reports and company websites. Case overview/synopsis: The case discusses the comprehensive renewable energy transition strategy that Lynn J. Good (Good), CEO and President of Duke Energy and the Chairman of its Board, was undertaking. In September 2019, Good revealed a new climate plan aimed at achieving net-zero carbon emissions with zero methane emissions from natural gas operations by 2030 and zero carbon emissions from electricity generation by 2050. Duke Energy is a Fortune 150 company headquartered in Charlotte, North Carolina and one of the major energy generation companies in the USA with two reportable business segments – Electric Utilities and Infrastructure (EU&I) and Gas Utilities and Infrastructure (GU&I). Good targeted interim carbon emission reduction targets of at least 50% from electric generation by 2030, 50% for Scope 2 and some Scope 3 upstream and downstream emissions by 2035 and 80% from electric generation by 2040. To achieve this, she invested in large electric grid upgrades and energy storage, as well as in research on zero-emission power generation technologies including hydrogen and advanced nuclear technologies. She helped update the grid system and improved customer experience. As part of the revamped climate strategy, Good invested in crucial energy infrastructure and improved affordability of electricity for customers, especially in the North Carolina region. Despite her efforts at curbing emissions, Good faced criticism from various quarters. This included criticism of Duke’s carbon-cutting plans in 2022 in its core North and South Carolina service zones. The company also faced charges of environmental pollution. Its 2024 strategy, which aimed to address a projected increase in demand for electricity using natural gas plants capable of running on hydrogen, was also met with skepticism by industry groups, advocates, activists and local governments. Good had to face the conflict between environmental ambitions and technological realities that highlighted the difficulties in transitioning to a cleaner energy future. It remained to be seen whether she would be able to successfully navigate the various hurdles and help Duke Energy reach its 2030 emission targets.

Purpose of the paper: The aim of our paper is to shed light on how the cultural tensions of being a socio-political activist and an iconic fashion entrepreneur in the current scenario of consumer movements and collective agitations are constructed and amplified in social media platforms. Methodology: We developed an in-depth critical case centered on Vivienne Westwood as person, leader, and brand. We adopted a netnographic research design that combined a diachronic, retrospective, and auto-biographical reconstruction of Vivienne Westwood’s life story, with non-participant observation of online posts, conversations, and comments centered on Westwood as person and as brand, shared on social media platforms. Results: Our study highlights a series of clashes that arise when an activist leader does not act as a true ethical leader of meanings and does not use engaging, and fine-tuning communication as a strategic lever to transform society through listening to, engaging, and fine-tuning with stakeholders, but rather indulges in a self-referential attitude aimed at giving full expression to her changing moods, needs, and desires. Practical implications: This paper highlights the challenges of being an activist leader and brand in contemporary woke society. In so doing, it provides strategic guidelines on how communication should be conceived in the company to achieve ethical leadership and overcome cultural tensions. Originality of the paper: This paper contributes to advance brand and CEO activism as well as strategic communication theoretical debate, through explicitly linking the tensions and the clashes between authentic purpose and commodified market logics emerging in social media platforms to a lack of exercise of ethical communication leadership on the part of the brand leader. © 2024 Fondazione Cueim.

Analyzing 10 years of corporate communication by Blackrock CEO Larry Fink, we show how his corporate activist rhetoric suggests a growing disregard for dialogic communication, which is typically articulated within American public relations scholarship as a vital component in, for example, Grunig’s Excellence Theory and Heath’s rhetorical perspectives. This analysis of Fink’s communication further suggests the need for American public relations scholarship to move beyond a false binary between external and internal approaches to activism, which is further complicated by Fink’s seeming lack of interest in dialogic communication. Relatedly, we note that the mainstream conception of public relations as a consensus-oriented, good faith exchange seems at odds with the emerging reality of a societal disposition for mere assertions.

Engaging in such activism could be risky for executives, given its potential to appease some stakeholders while alienating others. This begs the question: Why do some CEOs become sociopolitical activists while others remain on the “sidelines”? This study addresses this question by exploring the notion of the executive “bully pulpit” and how CEOs leverage their status and reputation to publicly engage in sociopolitical activism. Research Findings/Insights: Drawing from the status and reputation literature, we explore the effect of CEO power, CEO celebrity status, and firm reputation as predictors of CEO sociopolitical activism. In doing so, we focus on the “bully pulpit” explanation by arguing that powerful, high-status CEOs and those who lead firms with good reputations are more likely to use their professional position and visibility to advocate for or against controversial sociopolitical issues. Our analysis of CEO sociopolitical activism data from 246 matched-pair S&P 500 firms from 2007 to 2020 largely supports our arguments, though we find there is an important interaction between firm reputation and both CEO power and celebrity. Theoretical/Academic Implications: This study extends current research insights by highlighting how power, status, and reputation at the CEO and firm levels create a formidable platform (a “bully pulpit”) from which executive sociopolitical activism is exercised. Given its nascent nature, scholars are just beginning to empirically explore the consequences of CEO sociopolitical activism. This study contributes to ongoing work in this area by providing empirical evidence on the nature and drivers of CEO sociopolitical activism. Practitioner/Policy Implications: Firms seeking to play a more proactive role in contemporary sociopolitical issues need to consider hiring high-profile CEOs. Additionally, highly reputed firms are well-positioned to support their CEOs' efforts in influencing societal debates on controversial issues. © 2024 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","2024","2025-02-06 20:06:44","2025-02-06 21:08:34","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Code: Corporate Governance: An International Review Type: Article","","","","CEO activism; corporate governance; power; reputation; stakeholder theory; status","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The company's crisis communication strategies failed amid an onslaught of online and social media commentary from traditionally passive stakeholders and activists. The resultant damage to the company's reputation saw $95B wiped off the company's equity value and the CEO forced to resign. It is shown that crisis planning needs to be continually reviewed to take account of the evolving nature of social media during a crisis; in this instance, the use of Twitter proved particularly damaging to BP. Rolling crisis plans that encompass all media are required to provide the conclusive and swift action necessary to minimise the impact of a crisis. © 2014 Korean Scholars of Marketing Science.","2014","2025-02-06 20:06:44","2025-02-06 20:06:44","","113 – 128","","2","24","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Code: Journal of Global Scholars of Marketing Science: Bridging Asia and the World Type: Article","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Case overview/synopsis: Various stakeholders, regulators, environmental activists and public awareness have increased companies’ pressure to contribute to environmental issues. However, the pressure seems to be more on large-scale companies to make progress and have an elaborate vision and goals related to environmental issues than small and medium enterprises (SMEs). This case deals with the sustainability focus of the CEO of Ruscombe Artisan Food & Drink Ltd. (Made for Drink), an SME in the UK with a voluntary environmental impact investment proposal under consideration while having losses since 2017. The case integrates the financial aspects and environmental considerations into this strategic investment evaluation process for making a capital investment decision. The case provides the actual financials of the company, including the income statement, balance sheet and cash flow statement of the company since its inception in 2017. The case information enables students to comprehend and evaluate the consequences of doing a voluntary environmental capital investment project. The students will have the opportunity to apply simple capital investment methods and consider the external and less tangible environmental benefits in their final decision-making.

There is, however, scant research on how, if at all, listed South African FFs differ from their non-family counterparts concerning board composition and independence. The purpose of this study was to address this knowledge gap by investigating director and chair independence, chair-chief executive officer (CEO) role duality, board race and gender diversity, as well as board rotation at FFs listed on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange (JSE) over the period 2006 to 2022. The study was informed by the agency, socioemotional wealth, and stewardship theories. Design/methodology/approach: Data were collected on 753 directors who served on the boards of 37 JSE-listed FFs. Data sources included Bloomberg and the FFs’ integrated reports and websites. Data were analysed by examining trends in the considered variables over time. Findings/results: While family involvement at board level remained relatively constant, considerably fewer family members served as board chairs and CEOs towards the end of the research period. Board independence increased significantly over the research period. Practical implications: Shareholder activists’ requests for improved board governance of JSE-listed FFs seem justified. Activists should, however, also consider the benefits of family stewardship when evaluating director and chair independence in these firms. This study also identifies practical implications for nomination committees and investor education. Originality/value: The use of multiple theoretical lenses provides a balanced view of board governance at JSE-listed FFs. The study contributes to the scant body of knowledge on board composition and independence in listed FFs in South Africa, which will enable future FF research. © 2024.

Financial reporting performs an important societal role by helping control agency problems that arise from the separation of ownership and management. Since external stakeholders cannot “observe directly the extent and quality of managerial effort on their behalf […] the manager may be tempted to shirk […] blaming any deterioration of firm performance on factors beyond his/her control” (Scott, 2014, p. 23). However, although financial reporting helps hold managers accountable to shareholders, accounting information is not fully informative about managerial effort. For example, while net income provides useful information regarding the CEO’s stewardship, it is also “noisy,” due to recognition lags and other factors (Scott, 2014, p. 364). Efforts undertaken by Thompson in a particular period, such as marketing expenditures, might reduce current earnings, yet boost future profitability. Additionally, Thompson’s predecessor’s past efforts might have positive or negative effects on current earnings. Evaluating stewardship effectively involves considerable judgment, in addition to knowledge of financial accounting. The implication of poor firm performance is that the CEO is ineffective at formulating and implementing strategies and policies to enhance firm value (Dikolli et al., 2014). Specifically, it appears that missing earnings benchmarks matter more for relatively inexperienced CEOs. Don Thompson’s tenure of 33 months at McDonalds is 42 percent lower than median CEO tenure documented in academic research, where the median tenure of chief executives documented in large sample empirical studies is about 57 months (Dikolli et al., 2014). The evidence suggests that the longer a CEO serves, the less likely he is to be dismissed for performance-related reasons. This appears to be the result of the resolution of uncertainty about CEO’s ability and leads to subsequent declines in the level of monitoring by the Board of Directors. Performance evaluation and bias: a significant body of research explores the extent to which female managers are assessed differently than their male counterparts (Powell and Butterfield, 2002). For example, female CEOs face more threats from activist investors than male CEOs. Therefore, even after women achieve the highest managerial rank, they experience more professional challenges than their male counterparts (Gupta et al., 2018). However, the question of whether black CEOs are assessed differently is more challenging to answer empirically as a result of a smaller sample size (only one percent of S&P 500 companies are run by black CEOs). Our case attempts to develop the inference that if female CEOs are subject to bias, analogous forces are likely at work when black CEOs are assessed. Recent evidence further suggests that business students sometimes demonstrate bias in making assessments (Mengel et al., 2018). The authors discuss these findings – as well as strategies for including them in the case discussion – in the “Teaching Strategy” section herein below. Research methodology: The case was written from the public record surrounding the appointment of Don Thompson and McDonald’s company filings. The record includes articles from The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal, as well as local and industry publications. Case overview/synopsis: The case examines the role of financial accounting in evaluating CEO performance in the context of the appointment of McDonald’s first African-American chief executive and his subsequent two-and-a-half years on the job. The case deepens students’ understanding of the link between financial reporting and stewardship, while highlighting the subjectivity inherent in assessing managerial performance, particularly over relatively short time periods. As students analyze the case, they must consider the extent to which a firm’s results are attributable to luck vs skill. We use “skill” to refer to CEO effort and other controllable factors, while “luck” refers to exogenous factors, such as macroeconomic conditions. Assessing stewardship is of practical significance. It allows pay to be better aligned with performance and empowers stakeholders to identify when a change of leadership may be warranted. The case may also be used to spur reflection, in an applied context, on the importance of being alert to unconscious bias, even when evaluating seemingly objective financial reporting data. Recent research, discussed herein, suggests that business students sometimes exhibit bias when making assessments. Complexity academic level: The case should be included in discussions of corporate governance, executive compensation and the role of accounting information in efficient contracting. It is appropriate in intermediate financial accounting courses for undergraduates, introductory graduate accounting courses, or other courses with an element of financial statement analysis. Standard introductory accounting textbooks offer helpful supplementary reading for students. Horngren et al.’s (2014) book, Introduction to Financial Accounting (12th ed.), Pearson, London, provides an overview of the income statement and its role in assessing performance (see Chapter 2) as well as a useful discussion on evaluating the components and trends of a business (see Chapter 12). More advanced students may benefit from the in-depth discussion of earnings quality, operating income and non-operating income found in Chapter 4 of Intermediate Accounting (9th ed.), McGraw Hill Education, New York by Spiceland et al.

These competing expectations have created a scenario where engaging, not engaging, or incorrectly engaging in CEO activism all carry the risk of alienating at least some stakeholders and undermining CEO and firm reputation and performance. Further, extant research has primarily focused on whether CEOs engage in activism rather than disentangling the heterogeneous ways by which they do so. We address these shortcomings and augment existing theory by comprehensively considering distinct CEO activism engagement strategies, their outcomes, and the moderators influencing relations between the two. Moreover, we illuminate the highly heterogeneous nature of CEO activism to better capture the phenomenon’s complexity. We first introduce the CEO Activism Decision Matrix—a typology of four unique activism engagement strategies based on the behavioral dimensions of CEO Talk (leveraging communicative power) and CEO Action (leveraging economic power), successfully addressing the heterogeneity in activism behaviors that existing theory has overlooked. We then present an integrative conceptual model that outlines the short- and long-term consequences and relevant moderators of CEO activism engagement and offer detailed recommendations for future research, including methodological guidance on operationalizing variables and designing research that can infer causality. Altogether, we demonstrate that although CEOs may find themselves “damned if you do, and damned if you don’t” engage in activism, they also have the potential to drive meaningful career, firm, and societal change based on how they choose to engage. © The Author(s) 2024.","2024","2025-02-06 20:06:44","2025-02-06 20:06:44","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Code: Group and Organization Management Type: Article","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Although such activism may benefit their firms, the stated goal is often to mobilize the public and precipitate change. In an experiment with 4,578 respondents, we study the effect of CEO activism on people’s willingness to contact their U.S. senators about abortion. On average, showing a CEO message supporting abortion rights is not more effective at mobilizing pro-choice citizens than showing no message or showing a message from other speakers. Additionally, CEOs do not provoke countermobilization by people who oppose abortion. We explore heterogeneous treatment effects and find that CEO activism is better at motivating pro-choice citizens to engage in politics when their senators are Democrats and thus likely receptive to pro-choice activism, consistent with stakeholder alignment theory. Our findings contribute to research on leadership ethics and democracy by examining the ability of CEOs and organizations to foster engagement in the democratic process. © The Author(s) 2024.","2024","2025-02-06 20:06:44","2025-02-06 20:06:44","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Code: Journal of Business Ethics Type: Article","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

An online experiment was conducted using a randomized 2 (issue maturity: controversial vs. matured issue) x 2 (communication about motivation: society-serving vs. society- and firm-serving) full factorial design, drawing on samples of general consumers.

All sources are cited in the case narrative and as end notes. Case overview/synopsis: In April 2022, The Walt Disney Company and its CEO, Robert Chapek, were at the center of a controversy over the company’s opposition to the State of Florida’s Parental Rights in Education bill. The bill, dubbed “Don’t Say Gay” by its critics, prohibited instruction on sexual identity and gender orientation in the state’s elementary schools. The controversy stemmed from Disney’s initial non-reaction to the bill and its later strident opposition and call for its repeal. Chapek was pressured by negative media publicity and employee disgruntlement on the one hand and adverse economic consequences for opposing the bill by the state’s Governor, Ron DeSantis. Chapek and the Board had to respond to the political threats to Disney’s economic well-being while appeasing its employees and other stakeholders who wanted the company to be a corporate champion in diversity, equity and inclusion.

From a leadership and strategic management perspective, the case is well-suited for demonstrating the evolving expectations of leaders and corporate social responsibility, as well as the concepts of issue framing and nonmarket management.

It holds that corporations should communicate in ways that advocate for racial justice, attempt to improve race relations, and support achieving a more equitable and harmonious society. Corporations have this responsibility to race because they have historically perpetuated and profited from racial oppression, making corporations contributors to, and benefactors of, racial injustice. However, recently corporations have been using their platforms to speak against racial injustice in an effort to improve race relations. CRR theory provides a new way to readily identify, understand, contextualize, theorize and analyze corporate communication about race. Although CRR emerges from a Unites States perspective, and as a public relations concept, it has global applications in any place where racial difference leads to oppression, and it has analytical value in any field where organizational resources can be leveraged to fight oppression. © 2021 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","2021","2025-02-06 20:06:44","2025-02-06 20:06:44","","6 – 22","","1","33","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Code: Journal of Public Relations Research Type: Article","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Globally, trust is stagnating; in the USA, it has collapsed altogether. The corporate reputation bubble has burst, and with it, people’s trust that organisations will do the right thing. The flipside of these issues is an opportunity for companies to take action to restore trust and enhance reputation. At the top of the list is strong corporate purpose — the new business imperative that is quickly becoming today’s clarion call. Unlike traditional corporate social responsibility, a moral purpose should reflect a company’s DNA, serving as a natural extension of its business, addressing a societal problem like climate change or world hunger. Another area involves a renewed focus on earned media. Society is now looking to experts like trusted journalists as sources of credible information; companies must continue to cultivate relationships with them in order to tell their stories through respected media channels. There is also a new expectation for chief executives, who now must play the role of chief values officer and demonstrate activism for relevant causes to enhance reputation.

It introduces a model for selecting activism topics, emphasizing issue maturity and congruence as critical factors. The study investigates how topic selection influences public trust in CEO activism and perceptions of CEO leadership, ultimately impacting public support for the advocated issue and company loyalty. Design/methodology/approach: A randomized 2 × 2 experiment was conducted: issue maturity (mature vs controversial) and issue-company congruence (high vs low). Findings: Generally, CEO activism on mature issues fostered greater public trust and favorable evaluations of transformational leadership compared to controversial issues. However, issue-company congruency significantly moderated these effects. Mature, high-congruence issues led to increased trust, positive leadership evaluations and greater advocacy and company loyalty. In contrast, mature issues with low congruency did not yield the same positive outcomes. Controversial issues with high congruency resulted in the lowest levels of trust, potentially leading to backlash and diminished the positive impact of CEO activism. Originality/value: The results underscore the importance of strategic issue selection for CEO activism. Carefully chosen topics, considering both issue maturity and company-issue congruence, can effectively garner public support for the sociopolitical issue the CEO is advocating for while simultaneously enhancing perceptions of the CEO’s leadership and fostering company loyalty. © 2024, Emerald Publishing Limited.","2024","2025-02-06 20:06:44","2025-02-06 20:06:44","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Code: Corporate Communications Type: Article","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We find that the number of dividend-related questions raised by investors, the number of complaints (questions with negative attitudes), firm executive responsiveness, and CEO attendance in the OECC are positively associated with future dividend payouts. Moreover, positive responses are concentrated in firms facing greater pressure from peers, the market, and the regulator.

Case overview/synopsis: January 7, 2021, was not a good day for Goya Foods CEO Robert Bob Unanue, who has been at the helm of Goya since 2004. On that day, the nine-member board of directors of Goya censured Unanue for publicly questioning the legitimacy of the 2021 United States Presidential election. A day before, on January 6, a mob “trapped lawmakers and vandalized the home of Congress in the worst desecration of the complex since British forces burned it in 1814” (Hockstein, 2021). Unanue was considered a follower of former president Trump and has expressed that “the country was […] blessed to have a leader like President Trump, who is a builder” (Hawkins, 2020). In January 2021, Unanue appeared on Fox News and said a “ war was coming,” as Joe Biden’s election was “unverified.” These, among other words, motivated the censured by the board of Goya Foods, Inc. (Santana and Isidore, 2021). Students are asked the following questions for discussion: Did the board of directors of Goya Foods carry its role too far by openly censuring Unanue? Did Unanue go too far by openly expressing subjective opinions and thus influencing how people view the election results? Should he have remained as CEO of Goya Foods after his words on Joe Biden’s election?

The boycott demonstrates volatile collective action through heterogeneous and heterarchic encounters, characterized by the formation of a collective across geographical distance, vibrant interaction across political distance, and temporary presence. These features suggest the possibility of further activism by the middle class on shared ethical issues, and of unintended yet forceful consequences of activism on social media. Despite widespread concern about group polarization in cyberspace, social media also offer a space in which enclaves encounter opponents and subject their ideas to scrutiny. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","2012","2025-02-06 20:06:44","2025-02-06 20:06:44","","562 – 577","","4","56","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Code: Journal of Broadcasting and Electronic Media Type: Article","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Individual aspects of the board have increasingly been the focus of policy reform and shareholder activism. Specific attributes of board structure like the separation of the posts of chairperson and the CEO, percentage of outside directors on the board, etc., have become important considerations in the quest for effective corporate governance. In contrast, taking a process view of corporate governance, this article examines the utility of shareholder value analysis for corporate governance. In value-based management, shareholder value maximization is set as the objective of the firm. The adoption of this objective as the goal of the firm can promote effective corporate governance in three ways. First, it provides the necessary ‘pre-commitment’ between shareholders and managers regarding the goal of the firm. Second, it necessitates a greater flow of firm-specific information and the disaggregation of financial information. In corporate governance a clear identification of the goal of the firm and firm-specific information is important because of the incomplete contracts between shareholders and managers. Substantive flows of firm-specific information are needed to bridge the gaps in the incomplete contracts. Shareholder value management techniques, by providing this information in a non-agency context can provide a valuable input towards effective corporate governance. Finally, the goal of shareholder wealth maximization ensures a closer interdependence between strategy formation and the setting of operational objectives for managerial decisions. We illustrate some of these points with examples from the Lloyds–TSB experience of implementing shareholder value analysis and the findings of a study on investor communication. © 2006, Sage Publications India Pvt.

Using a sample of 93 firms placed on the Focus List of the Council of Institutional Investors from 2000 to 2005 and a comparison group of 96 firms in the bottom quartile in stock performance from the S&P500, the authors find that institutional investors respond to this negative third-party signal by reducing their holdings in firms that received this public repudiation. However, this reduction in holdings is moderated by the independence of the board of the targeted firm. This result suggests institutional investors pay particular attention to the governance characteristics of underperforming firms. Lastly, the authors found that targeted firms with more independent boards respond by increasing the intensity of incentives of the CEO, thus signaling their responsiveness to investor concerns. © 2009 Sage Publications.","2009","2025-02-06 20:06:44","2025-02-06 20:06:44","","107 – 135","","2","7","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Code: Strategic Organization Type: Article","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It raises the question of ""Why Institutions Matter"" to politics, by revisiting civil society organizations role, and ""Why Social Capital also Matters"" for making democracy work in South Korea. Promoting civil society activism is a necessary but insufficient condition for making democracy work. To support this notion the study turns to an analysis of the episode on how ""de-legitimization politics"" waged by certain civil society groups against the Lee government, during the anti-U.S. beefimport firestorm in the summer months of 2008. The legitimization challenge posed by certain civil society groups may have risked the danger of de-democratization of Korea's Sixth Republic, as intended by key opposition political forces. Yet, the campaign for de-legitimization of a constitutionally elected Lee Myung-bak Government did not succeed. © 2009 by the institute of korean studies.","2009","2025-02-06 20:06:44","2025-02-06 20:06:44","","233 – 271","","2","40","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Code: Korea Observer Type: Article","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
