However, a glaring gap lies in how CEOs engage in activism, particularly, through social media. Our study aims to bridge this gap by analyzing the online identity of Luciano Hang, a Brazilian CEO, activist, and billionaire, focusing on the crafting of Hang’s online identity, particularly on Instagram, using five personal branding mechanisms to influence broad sociopolitical issues. Hang’s unique case offers a lens for right-wing CEO activism, contrasting with mostly progressive cases in the western contexts. Using critical visual analysis to decode the Instagram content posted by Hang, who actively advocates for political conservatism, entrepreneurism, and economic liberalism, we find that CEO activists do not merely speak on specific issues, but carefully construct their online identity aligning with or challenging social norms and values. Our research extends the understanding of CEO activism by revealing its heterogeneous nature and connecting organization studies and marketing, in addition to demonstrating how CEOs can leverage personal branding to portray themselves as activists.","2025-01","2025-02-06 16:37:35","2025-02-06 16:37:35","","32-58","","1","78","","","","","","","","","","English","","","ABI/INFORM Collection; International Bibliography of the Social Sciences (IBSS); ProQuest One Psychology; Worldwide Political Science Abstracts","3149077440","","","Place: Thousand Oaks Publisher: SAGE PUBLICATIONS, INC.","","","https://libkey.io/libraries/3027/openurl?ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&ctx_enc=info:ofi/enc:UTF-8&rfr_id=info:sid/ProQuest&rft_val_fmt=journal&rft.genre=article&rft.jtitle=Human+Relations&rft.atitle=%26lsquo%3BBrazil+must+be+a+country+for+entrepreneurs+and+workers%2C+not+scoundrels%26rsquo%3B%3A+Personal+branding+mechanisms+underpinning+CEO+activism&rft.au=Barros+Amon%3BRosenthal%2C+Benjamin%3BCoelho+Caio%3BBruno%2C+Leandro.&rft.aulast=Barros+Amon&rft.aufirst=&rft.date=2025-01-01&rft.volume=78&rft.issue=1&rft.spage=32&rft.isbn=&rft.btitle=&rft.title=Human+Relations&rft.issn=00187267&rft_id=info:doi/10.1177%2F00187267241229036","Activism; Activists; anti-leftism; Brazil; CEO activism; Chief executive officers; Chief executives; Conservatism; Consumers; entrepreneur; Entrepreneurs; Executives (Business); Identity; Liberalism; Marketing; online identity; Personal brand; personal branding; Right wing politics; right-wing; social media; Social media; Social norms; Social values; Sociology; sociopolitical issues","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Brand communication refers to messages sent out through an organization's social media accounts, whereas CEO communication comes from the executive's personal account. The authors depart from an analysis of 236,119 tweets investigating the effects of message sender (CEO vs. brand), message framing (self vs. other), and message appeal (informational vs. emotional) on engagement (i.e., likes, retweets, and replies). To further understand, they subsequently deploy a 2 × 2 between-subjects design (N = 608) that introduces scenarios where either a CEO or brand proposes a public policy campaign, advocating support for U.S. citizens (self framing) or Ukrainian civilians (other framing). Key findings reveal that CEO communications foster greater engagement and digital activism than brand messages. CEO communication that merges self framed with informational appeals or other framed with emotional appeals outperforms brand messages regarding public engagement. In addition, CEO campaigns centered on Ukrainian civilians amplify digital activism, mirroring findings when brands approach the war's implications for U.S. citizens. Together, these insights unveil the intricate dance of message sender, framing, and appeal during global geopolitical events, providing vital knowledge for organizations and policy makers aiming to optimize public backing in times of war.","2025-01","2025-02-06 16:37:35","2025-02-06 16:37:35","","140-159","","1","44","","","","","","","","","","English","","","ABI/INFORM Collection; PAIS Index","3142652431","","","Place: Chicago Publisher: SAGE PUBLICATIONS, INC.","","","https://libkey.io/libraries/3027/openurl?ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&ctx_enc=info:ofi/enc:UTF-8&rfr_id=info:sid/ProQuest&rft_val_fmt=journal&rft.genre=article&rft.jtitle=Journal+of+Public+Policy+%26+Marketing&rft.atitle=Finding+the+Right+Voice%3A+How+CEO+Communication+on+the+Russia%26ndash%3BUkraine+War+Drives+Public+Engagement+and+Digital+Activism%3A+JPP%26amp%3BM&rft.au=Hamelberg+Kedma%3Bde+Ruyter+Ko%3Bvan+Dolen+Willemijn%3BKonu%C5%9F+Umut.&rft.aulast=Hamelberg+Kedma&rft.aufirst=&rft.date=2025-01-01&rft.volume=44&rft.issue=1&rft.spage=140&rft.isbn=&rft.btitle=&rft.title=Journal+of+Public+Policy+%26+Marketing&rft.issn=07439156&rft_id=info:doi/10.1177%2F07439156241230910","Activism; Business And Economics--Marketing And Purchasing; chief executive officer communication; Chief executive officers; Citizens; Communication; digital activism; Frame analysis; Geopolitics; message appeal; message framing; Policy making; public engagement; Public policy; Russia; Russia-Ukraine War; Social media; Ukraine; United States--US; war; War","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In particular, it focuses on the ideological alignment between a firm's upper echelons and its general employees. We theorize that participation in progressive corporate activism reflects the ideological views of both the top management team and general employees. By examining firm participation in letter campaigns supporting progressive causes, our findings indicate that ideological alignment between a top management teams and general employees' liberal political leanings is associated with a firm's participation in progressive corporate activism. The CEO's own ideological preferences do not have an independent association with this kind of activism. This article concludes with a discussion of implications for our understanding of corporate political action and nonmarket strategy.Managerial SummaryThis article looks at the relationship between political ideology and firm participation in sociopolitical activism. Although some have argued that firms' activism reflects a CEO's ideological preferences or employee activism, we find that neither explanation fully accounts for the kinds of companies that engage in this kind of activism. We find that progressive corporate activism reflects the ideological views of both top management and general employees. Our findings suggest that companies that have ideological alignment on progressive issues are more likely to take public stands on those issues because the stands reinforce core values held by employees and the top management.","2024-12","2025-02-06 16:37:35","2025-02-06 21:08:38","","2459-2518","","12","45","","","","","","","","","","English","","","ABI/INFORM Collection; International Bibliography of the Social Sciences (IBSS)","3128088807","","","Place: Chicago Publisher: Wiley Periodicals Inc.","","","https://libkey.io/libraries/3027/openurl?ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&ctx_enc=info:ofi/enc:UTF-8&rfr_id=info:sid/ProQuest&rft_val_fmt=journal&rft.genre=article&rft.jtitle=Strategic+Management+Journal&rft.atitle=When+ideologies+align%3A+Progressive+corporate+activism+and+within%E2%80%90firm+ideological+alignment&rft.au=McKean%2C+Anna+E%3BKing%2C+Brayden+G.&rft.aulast=McKean&rft.aufirst=Anna&rft.date=2024-12-01&rft.volume=45&rft.issue=12&rft.spage=2459&rft.isbn=&rft.btitle=&rft.title=Strategic+Management+Journal&rft.issn=01432095&rft_id=info:doi/10.1002%2Fsmj.3632","Activism; Business And Economics--Management; Chief executives; corporate activism; Corporate activism; Corporate management; Corporates; Employees; Human resource management; Ideology; Liberalism; Management journals; Management teams; Non-market strategy; nonmarket strategy; Organizational behavior; Participation; Political action; Political activism; Political ideologies; political ideology; Social activism; social movements; Social movements; Sociopolitical factors; Strategic management; Top management; Top management teams; upper echelons; Upper echelons; Upper management","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Furthermore, firms with CEO activism realize increased shareholdings from investors with a greater liberal leaning, who rebalance their portfolios toward these firms.

Our study complements this literature by using two controlled experiments and a series of semi‐structured interviews with CEOs and CFOs to investigate how a CEO's response to shareholder activism influences investors' reactions and whether these reactions differ depending on the gender of the CEO or on how their response is explained. In the first experiment, we find that investors evaluate a firm as less attractive when a female CEO uses an uncooperative response rather than a cooperative response to shareholder activism, absent any explanation for the CEO's response. Conversely, investors evaluate a firm as less attractive when a male CEO uses a cooperative response rather than an uncooperative response. In the second experiment, where there is an added explanation for the CEO response, we find that investors react more positively to a female CEO's uncooperative response when the explanation is more communal (vs. agentic). Our interviews with CEOs and CFOs provide insights into how the gender of firms' leadership may play a role when activist shareholders target firms. Our results collectively suggest that investors rely on gender stereotypes when evaluating the responses of male and female executives to shareholder activism and that these evaluations affect their investment judgments. Our results also suggest a potential alternative explanation for the finding that female CEOs are more likely to cooperate with activist shareholders than are male CEOs. Rather than inherent differences in the management styles of male and female CEOs, responses to activist shareholders may be driven, at least in part, by managers anticipating that they will be penalized by investors for deviating from gender‐stereotypical behavior.Alternate abstract:RésuméLe genre du PDG et les réactions à l'activisme actionnarialDes études récentes ont mis en lumière que les entreprises dirigées par des femmes sont davantage ciblées par des actionnaires activistes et que les femmes PDG sont plus enclines à prendre en compte les demandes de ces derniers. Cette étude apporte une contribution significative en réalisant deux expériences contrôlées et en menant des entretiens semi‐structurés avec des PDG et des directeurs financiers. Les auteurs examinent l'influence de la réaction d'un PDG face à l'activisme actionnarial sur les investisseurs, en fonction du genre du PDG ou de l'explication donnée à sa réponse. Dans la première expérience, les investisseurs perçoivent négativement une entreprise lorsque c'est une femme PDG qui réagit à l'activisme actionnarial en ne favorisant pas la collaboration, plutôt qu'en la favorisant, sans aucune explication de la réponse du PDG. À l'inverse, les investisseurs perçoivent négativement une entreprise lorsque c'est un homme PDG qui réagit à l'activisme actionnarial en favorisant la collaboration plutôt qu'en ne la favorisant pas. Dans la deuxième expérience, où la réponse du PDG est expliquée, les investisseurs réagissent de manière plus positive quand une femme PDG favorise la collaboration, surtout si l'explication est plus communale (que agentique). Les entretiens avec les PDG et les directeurs financiers soulignent le rôle du genre du dirigeant dans la gestion de l'activisme actionnarial. Les investisseurs semblent se baser sur des stéréotypes de genre pour évaluer les réactions des dirigeants masculins et féminins à l'activisme actionnarial, ce qui influence leurs décisions d'investissement. Ces résultats suggèrent aussi une autre explication possible au fait que les femmes PDG sont plus susceptibles que les hommes PDG de collaborer avec les actionnaires activistes. Au‐delà des différences de style de gestion entre PDG masculins et féminins, les réactions de ces derniers face à l'activisme actionnarial peuvent être provoquées, du moins en partie, par la crainte d'être sanctionnés par les investisseurs s'ils ne se conforment pas aux comportements stéréotypés associés à leur genre.","2024","2025-02-06 16:37:35","2025-02-06 21:08:21","","1726-1753","","3","41","","","","","","","","","","English","","","ABI/INFORM Collection; International Bibliography of the Social Sciences (IBSS)","3105621046","","","Place: Toronto Publisher: Canadian Academic Accounting Association","","","https://libkey.io/libraries/3027/openurl?ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&ctx_enc=info:ofi/enc:UTF-8&rfr_id=info:sid/ProQuest&rft_val_fmt=journal&rft.genre=article&rft.jtitle=Contemporary+Accounting+Research&rft.atitle=CEO+gender+and+responses+to+shareholder+activism&rft.au=Jackson%2C+Scott+C%3BRennekamp%2C+Kristina+M%3BSteenhoven%2C+Blake+A.&rft.aulast=Jackson&rft.aufirst=Scott&rft.date=2024-10-01&rft.volume=41&rft.issue=3&rft.spage=1726&rft.isbn=&rft.btitle=&rft.title=Contemporary+Accounting+Research&rft.issn=08239150&rft_id=info:doi/10.1111%2F1911-3846.12962","Activism; activisme actionnarial; Activists; Business And Economics--Accounting; CEO gender; Chief executive officers; Chief executives; Collaboration; Companies; engagement des investisseurs; Females; Gender; Gender differences; Gender stereotypes; Genre; genre du PDG; Interviews; investor engagement; Investors; Leadership; Males; Management styles; shareholder activism; Shareholder activism; Stereotyped behaviour; Stockholders","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Building on gender socialisation theory and the managerial power perspective, and with 2350 firm‐year observations from Standard and Poor's (S&P) 1500 companies in the United States for the years 2010–2018, we find that environmental activists display a greater propensity to target firms led by women CEO–Chairs at the shareholder proposal filing stage, while no significant preference is observed towards general women directors or CEOs. To explore the rationale behind this preference—whether it stems from gender discrimination or socialisation—we extend our investigation to the withdrawal stage and identify a significantly positive influence from both women CEOs and CEO–Chairs, with the influence from CEO–Chairs being more pronounced. We postulate that both the managerial power and women's socialised traits (such as being more altruistic, collaborative and communicative) are plausible explanations for this gender effect, and women without substantial legitimate power in environmental matters are unable to exert a significant impact.","2024-09","2025-02-06 16:37:35","2025-02-06 21:08:28","","5195-5213","","6","33","","","","","","","","","","English","","","ABI/INFORM Collection; International Bibliography of the Social Sciences (IBSS)","3123664424","","","Place: Chichester Publisher: Wiley Periodicals Inc.","","","https://libkey.io/libraries/3027/openurl?ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&ctx_enc=info:ofi/enc:UTF-8&rfr_id=info:sid/ProQuest&rft_val_fmt=journal&rft.genre=article&rft.jtitle=Business+Strategy+and+the+Environment&rft.atitle=Gender+diversity+and+environmental+activism%3A+Gender+discrimination+or+socialisation%3F&rft.au=Yu%2C+Jialing%3BYang%2C+Stephanie+Liu.&rft.aulast=Yu&rft.aufirst=Jialing&rft.date=2024-09-01&rft.volume=33&rft.issue=6&rft.spage=5195&rft.isbn=&rft.btitle=&rft.title=Business+Strategy+and+the+Environment&rft.issn=09644733&rft_id=info:doi/10.1002%2Fbse.3751","Activism; Altruism; Chief executives; Environmental activism; environmental shareholder activism; Environmental Studies; Environmentalism; Filing; Gender; gender discrimination; gender disparity; gender diversity; gender socialisation theory; management; managerial power; Power; Sex discrimination; Shareholder activism; Social; Socialization; Stockholders; United States; Women; women directors on corporate boards; womens status","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Using a sample of 3,259 activism events from 2004 to 2016, we identify 1,623 activist directors. Compared to other newly appointed directors, these activist directors tend to be younger, more likely to have finance and accounting skills, and less likely to be female. We find that the likelihood of acquiring board representation is associated with weaker market performance or lower payout ratios. Following the appointment of an activist director, we find evidence of increased divestiture, decreased acquisition activity, higher CEO turnover, increased leverage, higher payouts, and reduced investment. Our analysis of data on activists’ stated demands also shows that activist directors are effective in helping activists achieve their goals, consistent with the notion that board representation is an important mechanism for activists to bring about desired changes. Finally, we find positive abnormal returns of 1% when an activist director is appointed and a 3.2%-point increase in return on assets over the subsequent five years with an activist-affiliated director.","2024-09","2025-02-06 16:37:35","2025-02-06 21:08:18","","2578-2616","","3","29","","","","","","","","","","English","","","ABI/INFORM Collection","3089700328","","","Place: New York Publisher: Springer Nature B.V.","","","https://libkey.io/libraries/3027/openurl?ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&ctx_enc=info:ofi/enc:UTF-8&rfr_id=info:sid/ProQuest&rft_val_fmt=journal&rft.genre=article&rft.jtitle=Review+of+Accounting+Studies&rft.atitle=Activist+directors%3A+determinants+and+consequences&rft.au=Gow%2C+Ian+D.%3BShin%2C+Sa-Pyung+Sean%3BSrinivasan%2C+Suraj.&rft.aulast=Gow&rft.aufirst=Ian&rft.date=2024-09-01&rft.volume=29&rft.issue=3&rft.spage=2578&rft.isbn=&rft.btitle=&rft.title=Review+of+Accounting+Studies&rft.issn=13806653&rft_id=info:doi/10.1007%2Fs11142-023-09767-8","52394:Portfolio Management and Investment Advice; Activists; Boards of directors; Business And Economics--Accounting; Hedge funds; Shareholder activism","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Yet, CEOs are increasingly choosing sides in societal debates despite the inherent risk of alienating stakeholders who disagree with the CEO's stance. Even more puzzlingly, conservative CEOs sometimes espouse liberal stances in such debates, which runs counter to the otherwise consistent evidence in the upper echelons literature that CEOs are guided by their own values in their actions. Our study addresses this paradox by examining the antecedents of CEO liberal activism, with an emphasis on the interplay between the CEO's ideology and the prevailing ideological tilt of the employee population in driving CEOs' activism decisions. Drawing on the concept of managerial discretion, or latitude of action, we theorize that a pronounced organizational ideology constrains a CEO's ability to act in accordance with their own values-particularly in the highly symbolic domain of activism. We also argue that conservative CEOs are relatively more focused on instrumental rationales for activism, whereas liberal CEOs tend to prioritize more intrinsic rationales, a consequence of which is that conservative CEOs more heavily weight organizational ideology in their activism decisions. We test our theory in the context of a highly publicized letter signed by nearly 100 CEOs of public companies in opposition to North Carolina's controversial 2016 ""bathroom bill.""

The say‐on‐pay (SOP) mechanism—a vote in which shareholders express their (dis)agreement with executive pay designs—is one of the corporate governance mechanisms that has led to this activism among listed firms. Merging agency and socioemotional wealth (SEW) arguments, this paper analyzes how effective SOP voting results are among listed family firms in terms of CEO compensation efficiency and equity. Using a sample of UK listed firms from 2011 to 2018, our results show that SOP effectiveness is positively influenced by family ownership and is strongly moderated by family involvement in management and in governance as well as by family generation. Our findings stress the strong family effect and the ethical perceptions of family shareholders on SOP voting, showing how family participation in the firm encourages fairer and more aligned CEO compensation packages. SOP institutional and practical implications oriented to preserve shareholder value and family wealth are finally outlined.","2024-07","2025-02-06 16:37:35","2025-02-06 21:08:32","","308-330","","3","33","","","","","","","","","","English","","","ABI/INFORM Collection; International Bibliography of the Social Sciences (IBSS); ProQuest One Psychology","3066449699","","","Place: Oxford Publisher: Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","","","https://libkey.io/libraries/3027/openurl?ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&ctx_enc=info:ofi/enc:UTF-8&rfr_id=info:sid/ProQuest&rft_val_fmt=journal&rft.genre=article&rft.jtitle=Business+Ethics%2C+the+Environment+%26+Responsibility&rft.atitle=Shareholder+activism+in+listed+family+firms%3A+Exploring+the+effectiveness+of+say%E2%80%90on%E2%80%90pay+on+CEO+compensation&rft.au=Gregorio+S%C3%A1nchez%E2%80%90Mar%C3%ADn%3BGabriel+Lozano%E2%80%90Reina%3BJ+Samuel+Baixauli%E2%80%90Soler.&rft.aulast=Gregorio+S%C3%A1nchez%E2%80%90Mar%C3%ADn&rft.aufirst=&rft.date=2024-07-01&rft.volume=33&rft.issue=3&rft.spage=308&rft.isbn=&rft.btitle=&rft.title=Business+Ethics%2C+the+Environment+%26+Responsibility&rft.issn=26946416&rft_id=info:doi/10.1111%2Fbeer.12604","Activism; CEO compensation; Companies; Compensation; Corporate governance; Executive compensation; family heterogeneity; family listed firms; Family owned businesses; family ownership; Family relations; Ownership; Parent participation; Philosophy; say-on-pay effectiveness; say‐on‐pay effectiveness; Shareholder activism; Shareholder voting; Stockholders; Wealth","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The authors developed a conceptual model that proposes impression management as a mechanism for consumer response to CEO activism.Design/methodology/approachIn Study 1a, the authors examined 83,259 tweets from 90 CEOs and compared consumer responses between controversial and noncontroversial tweets. In Study 1b, the authors replicated the analysis, using a machine-learning topic modeling approach. In Studies 2 and 3, the authors used experimental designs to test the theoretical mechanism.FindingsOn average, consumers tend to respond more to CEO posts dealing with noncontroversial issues. Consumers’ relative reluctance to like and share controversial posts is motivated by fear of rejection. However, CEO fame reverses this effect. Consumers are more likely to engage in controversial activist threads by popular CEOs. This effect holds for consumers high (vs low) in public self-consciousness. CEO fame serves as a “shield” behind which consumers protect their online image.Research limitations/implicationsThe study focused on Twitter (aka “X”) in the USA. Future research may replicate the study in other social media platforms and countries.

Research on this practice has been primarily concerned with determining the conditions under which a CEO’s public statements on sociopolitical issues are beneficial or detrimental to her firm’s business performance. We complement this instrumental perspective on CEO activism with an ethical investigation of the implications of CEO activism for the democratic process. Drawing on political philosophy, we show that the answer to the question of whether CEO activism is conducive to the democratic process depends on the view of democracy that is adopted. From the perspective of liberalism, the sole requirement that an instance of CEO activism must fulfill is that it is lawful, provided that the applicable law sufficiently protects people’s essential rights. However, from the viewpoint of republicanism, this is not a sufficient condition. Besides being law-abiding, CEOs should be “civic-minded” when intervening in public debates, i.e., concerned with the quality and fairness with which those debates are conducted. Based on the literature on republicanism, we suggest four possible criteria that civic-minded CEOs can apply to gauge the democratic conduciveness of a possible public intervention: added insight, timeliness, constructiveness, and transparency. Our article complements the predominantly instrumentally oriented literature on CEO activism and contributes, more broadly, to the literature that explores the normative dimensions of corporate political involvement, as well as to a growing strand of research that draws on philosophical theory to inform business leaders’ ethical decision-making.","2024-04","2025-02-06 16:37:35","2025-02-06 21:08:38","","755-774","","4","190","","","","","","","","","","English","","","ABI/INFORM Collection; International Bibliography of the Social Sciences (IBSS); PAIS Index; ProQuest One Psychology","3032867139","","","Place: Dordrecht Publisher: Springer Nature B.V.","","; ","https://media.proquest.com/media/hms/PFT/1/00ZqX?_a=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%2BgIBToIDA1dlYooDHENJRDoyMDI1MDIwNjE2MDgzMzEzOToxMTg1MDM%3D&_s=SBFH9rFD2Kb9y4akMuoxo6wuao4%3D; https://libkey.io/libraries/3027/openurl?ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&ctx_enc=info:ofi/enc:UTF-8&rfr_id=info:sid/ProQuest&rft_val_fmt=journal&rft.genre=article&rft.jtitle=Journal+of+Business+Ethics&rft.atitle=When+Is+CEO+Activism+Conducive+to+the+Democratic+Process%3F%3A+JBE&rft.au=Feix%2C+Aur%C3%A9lien%3BWernicke%2C+Georg.&rft.aulast=Feix&rft.aufirst=Aur%C3%A9lien&rft.date=2024-04-01&rft.volume=190&rft.issue=4&rft.spage=755&rft.isbn=&rft.btitle=&rft.title=Journal+of+Business+Ethics&rft.issn=01674544&rft_id=info:doi/10.1007%2Fs10551-023-05446-5","Activism; Business; Business ethics; Chief executive officer; Chief executives; Debates; Decision making; Democracy; Ethical dilemmas; Ethics; Executives (Business); Law; Liberalism; Political participation; Political philosophy; Republicanism; Transparency","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Since the empirical literature remains inconclusive, we carried out the first comprehensive firm-level meta-analysis to reconcile the conflicting results from 112 studies involving 180 effect sizes across 32,953 firms spanning from 1989 to 2022. This provides a timely and up-to-date evaluation of the magnitude and nature of the engagement and influence of this significant stakeholder group on SR. Further, the study provides granular insights by dividing the overall effect on SR into three reporting dimensions-adoption, extent, and quality of reporting-to understand the impact of leverage on each and detail plausible reasons cited in the literature underpinning the positive or negative impact of debt providers on SR. The results show a positive significant impact of debt capital providers on SR, specifically, the adoption and extent of SR, but insignificant influence on SR quality, consistent with the findings of legitimacy theory. Debt capital providers' sustainability information needs remain limited to the ""act"" and ""extent"" of disclosure and concern for SR has not percolated to ""ask for quality,"" indicative of a rather surface-level care for SR practices of firms. Regarding the strength of this stakeholder group and its funding power, greater activism, advocacy, and informational sensitivity are required to encourage firms to engage in meaningful SR practices. Subgroup analysis and meta-regression techniques were used to account for potential conceptual and study-based moderators. Significant discrepancies were observed due to differences in content of reported issues, type of firm, leverage proxies, the sample period, and publication quality. The study emphasizes the need for proactive measures among debt capital providers to counteract the limited positive impact of leverage on sustainability reporting. By identifying research gaps and exploring implications for debt providers and companies, this study highlights how ESG-sensitive lenders can potentially steer firms towards quality SR practices. It offers valuable insights that could inform policy changes, foster collaboration, and advance the practice of sustainability-oriented lending.","2024-02","2025-02-06 16:37:35","2025-02-06 16:37:35","","14704-14747","","10","31","","","","","","","","","","English","","","MEDLINE®","2929096860; 38280168","","","","","","https://libkey.io/libraries/3027/openurl?ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&ctx_enc=info:ofi/enc:UTF-8&rfr_id=info:sid/ProQuest&rft_val_fmt=journal&rft.genre=article&rft.jtitle=Environmental+science+and+pollution+research+international&rft.atitle=Demystifying+the+influence+of+debt+providers%27+preferences+on+sustainability+reporting%3A+a+firm-level+meta-analytical+inquiry.&rft.au=Chadha%2C+Gurmani%3BSinghania%2C+Monica.&rft.aulast=Chadha&rft.aufirst=Gurmani&rft.date=2024-02-01&rft.volume=31&rft.issue=10&rft.spage=14704&rft.isbn=&rft.btitle=&rft.title=Environmental+science+and+pollution+research+international&rft.issn=1614-7499&rft_id=info:doi/10.1007%2Fs11356-023-31552-y","Debt capital providers; Disclosure; ESG disclosure; Index Medicus; Leverage; Meta-analysis; Meta-regression; Organizations; Subgroup analysis; Sustainability reporting","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In response to research calls to consider the individual level of analysis, we provide a narrative review to improve our understanding of the interconnections between CSR and individual behaviour. We organize existing research around three individual-level categories: CSR perceptions, CSR attitudes and CSR behaviours. We summarize research elucidating how perceptions and attitudes influence behaviours and how organization and higher-level CSR context and individual-level CSR readiness moderate perceptions-behaviours and attitudes-behaviours relationships.

The steadily growing number of such statements made in recent years has been subject to a flourishing academic debate. This field offers first profound findings from observational studies. However, the discussion of CEO activism lacks a thorough theoretical grounding, such as a shared concept accounting for the heterogeneity of sociopolitical incidents. Thus, the aim of this paper is to provide an archetypal framework for CEO activism.Design/methodology/approachThe authors used a multiple case study approach on 145 activism cases stated by CEOs and found seven distinct statement archetypes.FindingsThe study identifies four main structural design elements accounting for the heterogeneity of activism, i.e. the addressed meta-category of the statement, the targeted outcome, the used tonality and the orientation of the CEOs’ positions. Further, the authors found seven distinguishable archetypes of CEO activism statements: “Climate Alerts”, “Economy Visions”, “Political Comments”, “Self-reflections and Social Concerns”, “Tech Designs”, “Unclouded Evaluations” and “Descriptive Explanations”.Research limitations/implicationsThis typology classifies the heterogeneity of CEO activism. It will enable the analysis of interrelationships, mechanisms and motivations on a differentiated level and raise the comprehensibility of research-results.Practical implicationsThe framework supports executives in understanding the heterogeneity of CEO activism and to analyse personality-fits.Originality/valueTo the authors’ knowledge, this marks the first conceptualisation of activism developed cross-thematically. The work supports further theory-building on CEO activism.","2024","2025-02-06 16:37:35","2025-02-06 21:08:20","","370-397","","13","63","","","","","","","","","","English","","","ABI/INFORM Collection","3142704992","","","Place: London Publisher: Emerald Group Publishing Limited","","; ","https://media.proquest.com/media/hms/PFT/1/RG4qa?_a=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&_s=fqsIreNi5COxIaxGUTnQpT1fNLA%3D; https://libkey.io/libraries/3027/openurl?ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&ctx_enc=info:ofi/enc:UTF-8&rfr_id=info:sid/ProQuest&rft_val_fmt=journal&rft.genre=article&rft.jtitle=Management+Decision&rft.atitle=CEO+activism+is+not+equal+to+CEO+activism%3A+a+typology+of+executives%27+political+statements&rft.au=Rumstadt%2C+Franz%3BKanbach%2C+Dominik+K%3BArweck%2C+Josef%3BMaran%2C+Thomas+K%3BStubner%2C+Stephan.&rft.aulast=Rumstadt&rft.aufirst=Franz&rft.date=2024-01-01&rft.volume=63&rft.issue=13&rft.spage=370&rft.isbn=&rft.btitle=&rft.title=Management+Decision&rft.issn=00251747&rft_id=info:doi/10.1108%2FMD-07-2023-1297","Business And Economics--Management; CEO activism; Communication; Corporate social responsibility; Executives; Hypotheses; Non-market strategy; Political activism; Social activism; Social responsibility; Stakeholders; Typology; United States--US","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

CEO activism, wokewashing, and firm value","Strategic Management Journal","","01432095","10.1002/smj.3542","https://www.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/cashing-on-culture-wars-ceo-activism-wokewashing/docview/2889140354/se-2?accountid=12006","Research SummaryIn this article, we examine under what conditions CEO activism—the practice of corporate leaders to take public stances on sociopolitical issues—can create firm value. In our model consumers care about the type of firm they buy from, but also understand that corporate leaders can make false or misleading statements to pander to valuable demographics. We show that, although the profitability of CEO activism is severely compromised by this wokewashing, under some conditions credible, value‐enhancing sociopolitical communications can still take place. We characterize (i) when corporate leaders prefer to stay silent; (ii) when wokewashing is so widespread that no credible communication is possible; and (iii) when instead some credible communication can take place. We also show how an intrinsically motivated CEO can destroy or increase firm value.Managerial SummaryMany corporate leaders take public stances on sociopolitical issues and observers suggest that this practice can sometimes create firm value. A problem with the idea, however, is that, if taking a certain stance is indeed value enhancing, then many other CEOs may be tempted to take the same stance opportunistically. In this article, we study how CEO activism can be profitable when wokewashing is a real concern. We show that credible, value‐enhancing sociopolitical communications require controversial messages, as significant opposition from consumers with different worldviews is necessary to ensure the credibility of communications. Far from being a “bug,” controversy is a feature of credible CEO activism. We also demonstrate that a CEO's intrinsic motivation to take a stand can sometimes create value by making communications more credible. Obliquely, then, a CEO not primarily motivated by profits may be the best at maximizing profits.","2023-12","2025-02-06 16:37:35","2025-02-06 21:08:20","","3098-3121","","13","44","","","","","","","","","","English","","","ABI/INFORM Collection; International Bibliography of the Social Sciences (IBSS)","2889140354","","","Place: Chicago Publisher: Wiley Periodicals Inc.","","","https://libkey.io/libraries/3027/openurl?ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&ctx_enc=info:ofi/enc:UTF-8&rfr_id=info:sid/ProQuest&rft_val_fmt=journal&rft.genre=article&rft.jtitle=Strategic+Management+Journal&rft.atitle=Cashing+in+on+the+culture+wars%3F+CEO+activism%2C+wokewashing%2C+and+firm+value&rft.au=Melloni%2C+Gaia%3BPatacconi%2C+Andrea%3BVikander%2C+Nick.&rft.aulast=Melloni&rft.aufirst=Gaia&rft.date=2023-12-01&rft.volume=44&rft.issue=13&rft.spage=3098&rft.isbn=&rft.btitle=&rft.title=Strategic+Management+Journal&rft.issn=01432095&rft_id=info:doi/10.1002%2Fsmj.3542","Activism; Business And Economics--Management; CEO activism; cheap talk; Cheap talk; Chief executive officer; Chief executives; Communication; Condition; Consumers; Corporate leaders; Credibility; Culture wars; Firm value; Intrinsic motivation; Management journals; Profitability; Profits; Socio-political issues; Sociopolitical factors; strategic communication; Strategic communication; Strategic management; wokewashing; Wokewashing; Worldview","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We further examine whether the presence of external monitors, such as foreign and institutional investors, can moderate the impact of political connections on the performance of firms in Pakistan. In addition, we explore the association between political connections and firm performance during election and non-election years. This study uses 2479 firm-year observations for firms listed on the Stock Exchange of Pakistan from 2010 to 2019 as the final sample and uses regression to test the hypotheses. The findings of this study show that political connections are negative and strongly significant across all three performance indicators, such as ROA, ROE, and Tobin’s Q, indicating that political connections can harm firm value. Further analyses indicate that the detrimental impact of political connections on firm performance is attributable to CEOs who have political connections and is more pronounced during general election years in Pakistan. The findings further report some weak evidence of the monitoring roles played by foreign and institutional in mitigating the negative impact of political connections. Policymakers in Pakistan, therefore, ought to design stricter disclosure measures to limit the potential wealth expropriation in politically connected firms, given the lack of shareholder activism by outside shareholders in this country. Our results further suggest that external monitors, such as foreign and institutional ownership, play a relatively limited role in mitigating the adverse impact of political connections on the performance of firms.","2023-12","2025-02-06 16:37:35","2025-02-06 21:08:36","","","","2","10","","","","","","","","","","English","","","ABI/INFORM Collection; Publicly Available Content Database","2859758588","","","Place: Abingdon Publisher: Taylor & Francis Ltd.","","; ","https://media.proquest.com/media/hms/PFT/1/KoyZX?_a=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%2BgIBWYIDA1dlYooDHENJRDoyMDI1MDIwNjE2MDgzMzEzOToxMTg1MDM%3D&_s=X3mTCJWFbqo6tLHvxJLitfgUwoo%3D; https://libkey.io/libraries/3027/openurl?ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&ctx_enc=info:ofi/enc:UTF-8&rfr_id=info:sid/ProQuest&rft_val_fmt=journal&rft.genre=article&rft.jtitle=Cogent+Business+%26+Management&rft.atitle=Types+of+political+connections%2C+election+years%2C+and+firm+performance+in+Pakistan%3A+Moderating+role+of+external+monitoring&rft.au=Muhammad+Saif+Ul+Islam%3BWong%2C+Woei-Chyuan%3BMohd+Yushairi+Bin+Mat+Yusoff.&rft.aulast=Muhammad+Saif+Ul+Islam&rft.aufirst=&rft.date=2023-12-01&rft.volume=10&rft.issue=2&rft.spage=&rft.isbn=&rft.btitle=&rft.title=Cogent+Business+%26+Management&rft.issn=&rft_id=info:doi/10.1080%2F23311975.2023.2224139","Business And Economics--Management; connected CEO; connected chairman; election years; external monitoring; Financial performance; Foreign investment; Foreign investors; Institutional investor; Investment; non-election years; Pakistan; performance of firm; Political behavior; Political connections","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It shows how the socio-political context manifested in national and transnational policies, regulations and other socio-political events can influence the CEO talk about sustainability.Design/methodology/approachThis study adopts an interpretative and qualitative method of analysis using the lenses of the theoretical concepts of framing and legitimacy, analysing CEOs’ letters from 10 multinational industrial companies based in Sweden, over the period of 2008–2019.FindingsThe results show that various discourses of sustainability, emerging from policies and regulatory initiatives, socio-political events and civil society activism, are reflected in the ways CEOs frame sustainability over time. This article reveals that CEOs not only lead the discourse of profitable sustainability, but they also slowly adapt their sustainability talk to other discourses led by the policymakers, regulators and civil society. This pattern of a slow adaptation is especially visible in a period characterised by increased discourses of climate urgency and regulations related to social and environmental sustainability.Research limitations/implicationsThe theoretical frame is built by integrating the concepts of legitimacy and framing. Appreciating dynamic notions of legitimacy and framing, the study suggests a novel view of reporting as a film series, presenting many frames of sustainability over time. It helps the study to conceptualise CEO framing of sustainability as adaptive framing. This study suggests using a dynamic notion of adaptive framing in future longitudinal studies of corporate- and accounting communication.Practical implicationsThe results show that policymakers, regulators and civil society, through their initiatives, influence the CEOs' framing of sustainability. It is thus important for regulators to substantiate sustainability-related discourses and develop conceptual tools and language of social and environmental sustainability that can lead CEO framing more effectively.Originality/valueThe study engages with Goffman's notion of dynamic framing. Dynamic framing suggests a novel view of reporting as a film series, presenting many frames of sustainability over time and conceptualises CEO framing of sustainability as adaptive framing.","2023","2025-02-06 16:37:35","2025-02-06 21:08:18","","161-199","","9","36","","","","","","","","","","English","","","ABI/INFORM Collection; International Bibliography of the Social Sciences (IBSS); Worldwide Political Science Abstracts","2899405732","","","Place: Bradford Publisher: Emerald Group Publishing Limited","","; ","https://media.proquest.com/media/hms/PFT/1/y3cha?_a=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&_s=0OGDWLg3y8GDNv4IewTKUs8sbhc%3D; https://libkey.io/libraries/3027/openurl?ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&ctx_enc=info:ofi/enc:UTF-8&rfr_id=info:sid/ProQuest&rft_val_fmt=journal&rft.genre=article&rft.jtitle=Accounting%2C+Auditing+%26+Accountability+Journal&rft.atitle=Adaptive+framing+of+sustainability+in+CEO+letters&rft.au=Arvidsson%2C+Susanne%3BSabelfeld%2C+Svetlana.&rft.aulast=Arvidsson&rft.aufirst=Susanne&rft.date=2023-11-30&rft.volume=36&rft.issue=9&rft.spage=161&rft.isbn=&rft.btitle=&rft.title=Accounting%2C+Auditing+%26+Accountability+Journal&rft.issn=09513574&rft_id=info:doi/10.1108%2FAAAJ-11-2019-4274","Accounting; Adaptive framing; Annual reports; Business And Economics--Accounting; CEO talk; Chief executive officers; Chief executives; Civil society; Climate; Communication; Concept formation; Discourses; Executives (Business); Frame analysis; Goffman, Erving (1922-1982); Ideology; Industrial enterprises; Institutionalization; Legitimacy; Longitudinal studies; Motion pictures; Perceptions; Policy making; Political activism; Power; Qualitative research; Reconciliation; Regulation; Rhetoric; Social impact; Socio-political context; Sustainability; Sustainability discourse; Sustainability reporting; Sustainable development; Sweden; Text analysis; Transnationalism; Urgency","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Therefore, this paper integrates authentic leadership into signaling theory to identify CEO sociopolitical activism—a public and costly expression of personal political values by a company's highest and most visible leader—as an effective signal that is interpreted by job seekers to evaluate the CEOs’ degree of authentic leadership. Three experiments, including a parallel design for causal mediation inferences, and a field survey support that authentic leadership attributions mediate the positive impact of CEOs’ activism on job seekers’ employer attractiveness evaluations and employer choice. This mediation is attenuated when the activist CEO's espoused political values are incongruent with those of the job seeker and when the CEO engages in activism due to customer pressure rather than personal convictions. These findings primarily contribute to signaling theory and the literature on authentic leadership. For practitioners, the paper identifies a unique leadership signal that can contribute to an employer brand while cautioning about the costs this signal might impose on companies’ diversity.","2023-11","2025-02-06 16:37:35","2025-02-06 21:08:22","","2727-2765","","8","49","","","","","","","","","","English","","","ABI/INFORM Collection; International Bibliography of the Social Sciences (IBSS)","3066919082","","","Place: Tucson Publisher: Sage Publications Ltd.","","","https://libkey.io/libraries/3027/openurl?ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&ctx_enc=info:ofi/enc:UTF-8&rfr_id=info:sid/ProQuest&rft_val_fmt=journal&rft.genre=article&rft.jtitle=Journal+of+Management&rft.atitle=CEO+Sociopolitical+Activism+as+a+Signal+of+Authentic+Leadership+to+Prospective+Employees&rft.au=Appels+Moritz.&rft.aulast=Appels+Moritz&rft.aufirst=&rft.date=2023-11-01&rft.volume=49&rft.issue=8&rft.spage=2727&rft.isbn=&rft.btitle=&rft.title=Journal+of+Management&rft.issn=01492063&rft_id=info:doi/10.1177%2F01492063221110207","Activism; Attribution; authentic leadership; Authenticity; Business And Economics--Personnel Management; CEO sociopolitical activism; Chief executives; Employees; employer attractiveness; Job applicants; Job hunting; Leadership; signaling theory; Sociopolitical factors","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Evidence from SOEs in China","Corporate Governance : An International Review","","09648410","10.1111/corg.12510","https://www.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/when-does-female-leadership-advantage-exist/docview/2891933902/se-2?accountid=12006","Research Question/IssueWe approach the ongoing debate in the literature on when and why a female leadership advantage exists in the context of China. In particular, we examine whether female CEOs outperform male CEOs in state‐owned enterprises (SOEs).Research Findings/InsightsWe show that a female leadership advantage exists in SOEs. We find that the female leadership increased performance is attributed to improved profitability, capital structure, and operating efficiency. The magnitude of this gender effect is bigger in central state‐owned enterprises (CSOEs) than that in local state‐owned enterprises (LSOEs). The results are robust to additional tests that mitigate the sample selection and other endogeneity concerns.Theoretical/Academic ImplicationsWe use the role congruity theory to motivate and develop the hypotheses drawing insights upon the literature in psychology and leadership. Female CEOs are perceived as less congruent with their leadership roles given the gender role stereotypes. Thus, they face more challenges and difficulties than male CEOs. These obstacles take at least two forms which are significant in SOEs: shareholder activism and sex discrimination. Female CEOs have to outperform their male counterparts to alleviate the pressure from shareholder activism and showcase their managerial skills and abilities.Practitioner/Policy ImplicationsFor the state shareholders, the extra scrutiny in selecting female CEOs should be lifted given this outperformance. The evidence is also relevant for CEOs to choose their career paths among different types of firms, for boards of directors on their strategic decisions on CEO hiring, and for policy makers to promote the female leadership advantage.","2023-11","2025-02-06 16:37:35","2025-02-06 21:08:37","","945-970","","6","31","","","","","","","","","","English","","","ABI/INFORM Collection; International Bibliography of the Social Sciences (IBSS)","2891933902","","","Place: Oxford Publisher: Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","","","https://libkey.io/libraries/3027/openurl?ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&ctx_enc=info:ofi/enc:UTF-8&rfr_id=info:sid/ProQuest&rft_val_fmt=journal&rft.genre=article&rft.jtitle=Corporate+Governance+%3A+An+International+Review&rft.atitle=When+does+a+female+leadership+advantage+exist%3F+Evidence+from+SOEs+in+China&rft.au=Li%2C+Hanchen%3BTong%2C+Xiaochuan.&rft.aulast=Li&rft.aufirst=Hanchen&rft.date=2023-11-01&rft.volume=31&rft.issue=6&rft.spage=945&rft.isbn=&rft.btitle=&rft.title=Corporate+Governance+%3A+An+International+Review&rft.issn=09648410&rft_id=info:doi/10.1111%2Fcorg.12510","Activism; Advantages; Business And Economics; Capital structure; Career development; Chief executive officers; Chief executives; China; corporate governance; female leadership advantage; Females; firm performance; Gender; Gender roles; government ownership; Hiring; Leadership; Males; Policy making; Profitability; Psychology; Role congruity theory; Scrutiny; Sex discrimination; Shareholder activism; State-owned enterprise; Stereotypes; Stockholders","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Using qualitative thematic analysis of CrossFit affiliates’ Facebook and Instagram posts made during June 2020, we find that the affiliates had a range of responses that included silence, reconsideration of their affiliate status, and social activism. Furthermore, we find that the affiliates’ focus on (re)defining community served to deflect from deeper discussions of systemic racism within CrossFit and the CrossFit community.","2023-09","2025-02-06 16:37:35","2025-02-06 21:08:36","","312-320","","3","40","","","","","","","","","","English","","","Sociological Abstracts","3163626702","","","Place: Champaign Publisher: Human Kinetics Publishers, Inc.","","","https://libkey.io/libraries/3027/openurl?ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&ctx_enc=info:ofi/enc:UTF-8&rfr_id=info:sid/ProQuest&rft_val_fmt=journal&rft.genre=article&rft.jtitle=Sociology+of+Sport+Journal&rft.atitle=%26ldquo%3BThey+Do+Not+Represent+Our+Gym%26rdquo%3B%3A+How+CrossFit+Affiliates+Define+Community+as+They+Respond+to+Racial+Controversy&rft.au=Edmonds%2C+Shaun%3BMalcom%2C+Nancy+L%3BGipson%2C+Christina+M%3BBennett%2C+Hannah.&rft.aulast=Edmonds&rft.aufirst=Shaun&rft.date=2023-09-01&rft.volume=40&rft.issue=3&rft.spage=312&rft.isbn=&rft.btitle=&rft.title=Sociology+of+Sport+Journal&rft.issn=07411235&rft_id=info:doi/10.1123%2Fssj.2022-0074","activism; Activism; article; Community; human; human experiment; social media; Social media; Sociology; structural racism; Systemic racism; thematic analysis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The results indicate that appointments of CEOs who are recruited with shareholder activist influence are associated with more favorable stock market reactions and stronger profitability improvements than appointments without activist involvement. In contrast, I find little evidence that shareholder influence is followed by the recruitment of CEOs who implement myopic corporate policies. Additional analyses reveal positive associations between activist involvement and (1) the amount of resources being dedicated to the CEO search process and (2) the propensity to recruit CEOs from outside the firm. These findings extend the CEO labor market literature, which so far focuses mainly on the decision to remove incumbent CEOs and provides limited insights into CEO recruiting.","2023-09","2025-02-06 16:37:35","2025-02-06 21:08:32","","353","","5","98","","","","","","","","","","English","","","ABI/INFORM Collection; International Bibliography of the Social Sciences (IBSS)","2867358850","","","Place: Sarasota Publisher: American Accounting Association","","","https://libkey.io/libraries/3027/openurl?ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&ctx_enc=info:ofi/enc:UTF-8&rfr_id=info:sid/ProQuest&rft_val_fmt=journal&rft.genre=article&rft.jtitle=The+Accounting+Review&rft.atitle=Shareholder+Activists+and+Frictions+in+the+CEO+Labor+Market&rft.au=Keusch%2C+Thomas.&rft.aulast=Keusch&rft.aufirst=Thomas&rft.date=2023-09-01&rft.volume=98&rft.issue=5&rft.spage=353&rft.isbn=&rft.btitle=&rft.title=The+Accounting+Review&rft.issn=00014826&rft_id=info:doi/10.2308%2FTAR-2020-0485","Activists; Appointments & personnel changes; Chief executive officer; Chief executive officers; Chief executives; Education; Hiring; Labor market; Profitability; Recruitment; Securities markets; Shareholder; Shareholder activism; Stockholders","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We develop a framework where activist shareholders resolve this problem by forming attributions about executives' intentions based on their displays of agentic values, which reflect independence and control. For activist shareholders, a strong display of independence can evoke concerns that an executive will act without the regulation of shareholder input, and a strong display of control can create concerns an executive will engineer governance provisions to their own benefit. As such, we hypothesize that above-average agentic value displays by CEOs increase the likelihood firms are targeted by shareholder activists. Extending our theory, we argue the positive effect that agentic value displays have on attracting shareholder activism is stronger when CEOs permit higher spending on corporate and stakeholder investment, both of which can exacerbate shareholder harm when executed poorly. We also posit that activism campaigns driven by CEOs' agentic value displays will largely come from activist shareholders seeking to exert their own control over agentic-speaking CEOs. Using data on shareholder activism campaigns at US-based companies from 2003–2018, we find support for our hypotheses. We discuss multiple theoretical implications for research on corporate governance, stakeholder management, and investor relations.","2023-08","2025-02-06 16:37:35","2025-02-06 16:37:35","","1577","","4","34","","","","","","","","","","English","","","ABI/INFORM Collection; International Bibliography of the Social Sciences (IBSS); ProQuest One Psychology","2843133759","","","Place: Linthicum Publisher: Institute for Operations Research and the Management Sciences","","","https://libkey.io/libraries/3027/openurl?ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&ctx_enc=info:ofi/enc:UTF-8&rfr_id=info:sid/ProQuest&rft_val_fmt=journal&rft.genre=article&rft.jtitle=Organization+Science&rft.atitle=The+Downside+of+Displaying+Agentic+Values%3A+Evidence+from+Shareholder+Activism&rft.au=DesJardine%2C+Mark+R%3BShi%2C+Wei.&rft.aulast=DesJardine&rft.aufirst=Mark&rft.date=2023-07-01&rft.volume=34&rft.issue=4&rft.spage=1577&rft.isbn=&rft.btitle=&rft.title=Organization+Science&rft.issn=10477039&rft_id=info:doi/10.1287%2Forsc.2022.1637","Activism; Activists; Attribution; Business And Economics--Management; Campaigns; Chief executive officers; Chief executives; Corporate governance; Executives; Investor relations; Shareholder; Shareholder activism; Shareholder voting; Stakeholder management; Stakeholders; Stockholders","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Yet we do not fully understand how these activist investors, despite holding only a small stake in target firms, are able to influence management and the board to acquiesce to their demands, especially given the large uncertainty that their demands will improve shareholder value. Building on impression management (IM) theory, we propose that activist investors who express their concerns and demands with high confidence in their letters to target firms are likely to be perceived as knowledgeable and competent by the firm's other shareholders, thus influencing the response of the firm's management and board. In support of this theoretical proposition, results of our empirical analysis of 475 U.S. activist campaigns against U.S. companies between 2007 and 2019 suggest that confidence in tone in an activist's letter, as a form of self-promotion, is positively associated with campaign success. We also observe that the positive association between confidence in tone in activist letters and campaign success is less for activists with greater success in prior campaigns and in campaigns with multiple activists. Our paper contributes to financial activism research by showing that activists' verbal impression management can serve as an effective influence tactic in their campaigns. Our study also contributes to the emerging research stream on verbal IM by introducing a language attribute, confidence in tone, that has not been studied in management research and is distinct from past constructs examined in verbal IM research.","2023-08","2025-02-06 16:37:35","2025-02-06 21:08:24","","1487","","4","34","","","","","","","","","","English","","","ABI/INFORM Collection; International Bibliography of the Social Sciences (IBSS); ProQuest One Psychology","2843131640","","","Place: Linthicum Publisher: Institute for Operations Research and the Management Sciences","","","https://libkey.io/libraries/3027/openurl?ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&ctx_enc=info:ofi/enc:UTF-8&rfr_id=info:sid/ProQuest&rft_val_fmt=journal&rft.genre=article&rft.jtitle=Organization+Science&rft.atitle=%26quot%3BDear+CEO+and+Board%26quot%3B%3A+How+Activist+Investors%27+Confidence+in+Tone+Influences+Campaign+Success&rft.au=Brauer%2C+Matthias%3BWiersema%2C+Margarethe%3BBinder%2C+Philipp.&rft.aulast=Brauer&rft.aufirst=Matthias&rft.date=2023-07-01&rft.volume=34&rft.issue=4&rft.spage=1487&rft.isbn=&rft.btitle=&rft.title=Organization+Science&rft.issn=10477039&rft_id=info:doi/10.1287%2Forsc.2022.1625","52394:Portfolio Management and Investment Advice; Activism; Activists; Business And Economics--Management; Campaigns; Confidence; Hedge funds; Impression management; Investors; Selfpromotion; Shareholder activism; Shareholder value; Stockholders; Strategic communication; Success; Uncertainty; United States--US","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Emergent research on this phenomenon has explored the prevalence, impacts and risks of increasing CEO activism for firms. However, very little research has explored the individual and institutional factors that motivate CEO activism. This project attempts to refocus this nascent field by exploring the gendered, racial, sexual and organizational factors that motivate leaders to speak out on issues ranging from DEI, gun control, climate change, Black Lives Matter and #MeToo.MethodTo answer our research question ‐ who speaks? ‐ we examined CEOs, companies, and key social issues within the Proquest Newsstand Database. First, we conducted a large exploratory study of random men and women CEOs to determine if gender differences exist. Next, we examined all women CEOs in the Fortune 500 and S&P 500 between 2019–2021 to provide a more thorough and nuanced analysis.ResultsWe find that women CEOs are more likely to speak out compared to men CEOs. Further, we find that BIPOC and LGBTQ+ CEOs are more likely to engage in activism compared to other CEOs. We also find that the market value of the firm and the presence of women on the board of directors serve as significant predictors of CEO activism compared to other firms.ConclusionWe consider the implications of these findings for the appointment, tenure and visibility of historically underrepresented CEOs.","2023-07","2025-02-06 16:37:35","2025-02-06 21:08:38","","521-534","","4","104","","","","","","","","","","English","","","ABI/INFORM Collection; International Bibliography of the Social Sciences (IBSS); Sociological Abstracts; Worldwide Political Science Abstracts","2836858153","","","Place: Oxford Publisher: Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","","","https://libkey.io/libraries/3027/openurl?ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&ctx_enc=info:ofi/enc:UTF-8&rfr_id=info:sid/ProQuest&rft_val_fmt=journal&rft.genre=article&rft.jtitle=Social+Science+Quarterly&rft.atitle=Who+speaks%3F+Individual+and+institutional+predictors+of+CEO+activism&rft.au=Cook%2C+Alison%3BGlass%2C+Christy%3BIngersoll%2C+Alicia+R.&rft.aulast=Cook&rft.aufirst=Alison&rft.date=2023-07-01&rft.volume=104&rft.issue=4&rft.spage=521&rft.isbn=&rft.btitle=&rft.title=Social+Science+Quarterly&rft.issn=00384941&rft_id=info:doi/10.1111%2Fssqu.13276","Activism; Black Lives Matter movement; Board of directors; CEO activism; Chief executive officer; Chief executives; Climate change; Databases; diversity; Executives (Business); Firearm laws & regulations; Gender differences; gender in leadership; LGBTQ people; Market value; Organizational factors; Political factors; Research; Social issues; Social Sciences: Comprehensive Works; Visibility; Women; women CEOs","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This study’s typology highlights the need for greater understanding of CEOs’ sociopolitical activism for the CEO as an individual actor and for the company they represent.Design/methodology/approachThis study’s approach is to conceptually review the literature on CEO activism and to create a theoretic framework for future analysis of the antecedents and motivations and ramifications of CEOs’ sociopolitical activism for the CEO as an individual actor and for the company they represent. The author highlights four theories and seeks future application of these theories to the phenomena in a typology.FindingsThe typology highlights the application of management theories to various ramifications of CEO activism to four influences on CEO activities. Upper echelons theory helps explain the motivation of a CEO internally, whereas agency theory applies to CEO activism internal to the CEO and external to the organizational operations. External to the CEO, organizational culture theory supports responses internal to the organization, and stakeholder theory provides insight into responses external to the CEO and the organization.Originality/valueThis study provides conceptual support for the study of CEO activism and encourages future research on the topic.","2023","2025-02-06 16:37:35","2025-02-06 21:08:37","","422-438","","3","18","","","","","","","","","","English","","","ABI/INFORM Collection","2829680231","","","Place: Bradford Publisher: Emerald Group Publishing Limited","","; ","https://media.proquest.com/media/hms/PFT/1/pGFUS?_a=ChgyMDI1MDIwNjE2MTUwMDU2NTo5NDExNTcSBjEwMjEyNhoKT05FX1NFQVJDSCIPMTI4LjE3OS4xNTQuMjQzKgUyODM1NDIKMjgyOTY4MDIzMToNRG9jdW1lbnRJbWFnZUIBMFIGT25saW5lWgJGVGIDUEZUagoyMDIzLzA3LzAxcgoyMDIzLzA5LzMwegCCASlQLTEwMDAwMDEtMTIwMDYtQ1VTVE9NRVItMTAwMDAwMDgtMTgwNjk2OJIBBk9ubGluZcoBdU1vemlsbGEvNS4wIChNYWNpbnRvc2g7IEludGVsIE1hYyBPUyBYIDEwXzE1XzcpIEFwcGxlV2ViS2l0LzUzNy4zNiAoS0hUTUwsIGxpa2UgR2Vja28pIENocm9tZS8xMzEuMC4wLjAgU2FmYXJpLzUzNy4zNtIBElNjaG9sYXJseSBKb3VybmFsc5oCB1ByZVBhaWSqAitPUzpFTVMtTWVkaWFMaW5rc1NlcnZpY2UtZ2V0TWVkaWFVcmxGb3JJdGVtygIPQXJ0aWNsZXxGZWF0dXJl0gIBWfICAPoCAU6CAwNXZWKKAxxDSUQ6MjAyNTAyMDYxNjA4MzMxMzk6MTE4NTAz&_s=TuGgBN%2B1HNWtV%2BBYQg%2BlrY3jl5g%3D; https://libkey.io/libraries/3027/openurl?ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&ctx_enc=info:ofi/enc:UTF-8&rfr_id=info:sid/ProQuest&rft_val_fmt=journal&rft.genre=article&rft.jtitle=Society+and+Business+Review&rft.atitle=What+did+they+say%3F+A+typology+of+CEO+activism&rft.au=Cycyota%2C+Cynthia+S.&rft.aulast=Cycyota&rft.aufirst=Cynthia&rft.date=2023-07-01&rft.volume=18&rft.issue=3&rft.spage=422&rft.isbn=&rft.btitle=&rft.title=Society+and+Business+Review&rft.issn=17465680&rft_id=info:doi/10.1108%2FSBR-05-2022-0154","Activism; Activists; Boards of directors; CEO activism; Chief executive officer; Chief executive officers; Competition; Consumer attitudes; Customers; Decision making; Employee activism; Employees; Freedom of religion; Indiana; Influence; LGBTQ people; Organizational governance; Political activism; Shareholder activism; Social responsibility; Sociology; Sociopolitical actions; Sociopolitical factors; Stakeholder Theory; Stakeholders; State laws; United States--US","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Activist groups and community members argued for the vendor’s removal from the market at public meetings and protested the vendor’s stand throughout the remainder of the season. Remarkably, official policy and much of public sentiment resolved on the side of the white supremacist vendor, while activists were arrested and silenced. Drawing on discourse analysis and participant observation, this article addresses three related dynamics. First, we highlight the resonances between the nostalgic rhetoric of local food and aspects of white nationalist ideology to explain why white supremacists in general might see farmers’ markets as an appropriate site to further their racial project. Second, we illustrate how overlapping themes including motherhood, community membership, and organic links between people and land operated to shield the white supremacist vendor from public scrutiny. Finally, we show how parallel rhetoric was deployed against activists who objected to the presence of white supremacists in the market, so the activists became the identified source of disruption and exclusionary violence.","2023","2025-02-06 16:37:35","2025-02-06 16:37:35","","84-94","","2","23","","","","","","","","","","English","","","ProQuest One Literature","2821028540","","","Place: Berkeley Publisher: University of California Press Books Division","","","https://libkey.io/libraries/3027/openurl?ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&ctx_enc=info:ofi/enc:UTF-8&rfr_id=info:sid/ProQuest&rft_val_fmt=journal&rft.genre=article&rft.jtitle=Gastronomica&rft.atitle=Nostalgia+and+the+Protection+of+White+Supremacy+at+a+Public+Farmers%26rsquo%3B+Market&rft.au=Babb%2C+Angela%3BBetz%2C+Megan%3BSang-hyoun+Pahk%3BSmith%2C+Isis.&rft.aulast=Babb&rft.aufirst=Angela&rft.date=2023-07-01&rft.volume=23&rft.issue=2&rft.spage=84&rft.isbn=&rft.btitle=&rft.title=Gastronomica&rft.issn=15293262&rft_id=info:doi/10.1525%2Fgfc.2023.23.2.84","Activists; Aggression; Discourse analysis; Economic; Farmers; Farmers' market; Food; Food And Food Industries; Nostalgia; Organic food; Rhetoric; White nationalism; White supremacy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Corporate giving discourages managers from pursuing external financing, especially debt issuance, to minimize outside monitoring. It creates preferences for internally financed cash acquisitions for the same reason. These distortions reduce shareholder wealth. Following both the 2003 dividend tax cut and hedge fund activism, corporate charitable contributions fall while investment rises, suggesting suboptimal investment caused by managerial private benefit extraction. Acquisition announcements of firms making large charitable contributions show negative stock market reactions that are more pronounced for acquirers with poor corporate governance.Theoretical/Academic ImplicationsOur findings suggest that due to agency problems and managerial rent extraction, corporate philanthropic activities can distort corporate financing and investment decisions and yield corporate charitable contribution allocations that personally benefit a firm's CEO at shareholder expense.Practitioner/Policy ImplicationsAs corporate philanthropy imposes a significant cost to shareholders, managers may seek shareholder approval on corporate philanthropic activities. The Securities and Exchange Commission may also require timely disclosure of corporate donations.","2023-05","2025-02-06 16:37:35","2025-02-06 21:08:30","","464-490","","3","31","","","","","","","","","","English","","","ABI/INFORM Collection; International Bibliography of the Social Sciences (IBSS)","2810749147","","","Place: Oxford Publisher: Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","","","https://libkey.io/libraries/3027/openurl?ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&ctx_enc=info:ofi/enc:UTF-8&rfr_id=info:sid/ProQuest&rft_val_fmt=journal&rft.genre=article&rft.jtitle=Corporate+Governance+%3A+An+International+Review&rft.atitle=Private+benefits+of+corporate+philanthropy+and+distortions+to+corporate+financing+and+investment+decisions&rft.au=Masulis%2C+Ronald+W%3BSyed%2C+Walid+Reza.&rft.aulast=Masulis&rft.aufirst=Ronald&rft.date=2023-05-01&rft.volume=31&rft.issue=3&rft.spage=464&rft.isbn=&rft.btitle=&rft.title=Corporate+Governance+%3A+An+International+Review&rft.issn=09648410&rft_id=info:doi/10.1111%2Fcorg.12476","Business And Economics; Charities; corporate giving; corporate governance; Corporate governance; Donations; Extraction; Financing; financing decisions; hedge fund activism; Investment decision; investment decisions; Investments; Philanthropy; private benefits of control; Private benefits of control; Securities markets; Stockholders; Wealth","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Investors and investment analysts demand this information because executives, directors and large shareholders are expected to have more intimate knowledge of their company's prospects than outsiders. Insider stock sales and purchases may reveal information about the firm's business not disclosed in financial statements. They may also convey new information predictive of stock price movements if insiders can better interpret public information about the firm. Since mid-2003, the Securities and Exchange Commission has made these insider trading reports available to the public in a structured format; however, most academic papers use proprietary commercial databases instead of regulatory filings directly. This makes replication challenging as the data manipulation and aggregation processes are opaque and historical records could be altered by the database provider over time. To overcome these limitations, the presented dataset is created from original regulatory filings; it is updated daily and includes all information reported by insiders without alteration.","2023-04-26","2025-02-06 16:37:35","2025-02-06 16:37:35","","237","","1","10","","","","","","","","","","English","","","MEDLINE®","2814524202; 37185601","","","","","","https://libkey.io/libraries/3027/openurl?ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&ctx_enc=info:ofi/enc:UTF-8&rfr_id=info:sid/ProQuest&rft_val_fmt=journal&rft.genre=article&rft.jtitle=Scientific+data&rft.atitle=Insider+trading.&rft.au=Balogh%2C+Attila.&rft.aulast=Balogh&rft.aufirst=Attila&rft.date=2023-04-26&rft.volume=10&rft.issue=1&rft.spage=237&rft.isbn=&rft.btitle=&rft.title=Scientific+data&rft.issn=2052-4463&rft_id=info:doi/10.1038%2Fs41597-023-02147-6","Index Medicus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Commentators have tried to fit this development into familiar frameworks of shareholder value or management entrenchment. In contrast, in this Article we develop, for the first time, a theory of ESG as a product of social demand. Our framework shows that increasing demand for socially responsible corporate behavior, originating in but not limited to the millennial generation, has created powerful incentives for corporate managers to promote ESG goals. We identify and analyze five specific channels of social demand that pressure CEOs to promote ESG. First, markets-consumers, employees, and investors-may reward firms for promoting ESG. Second, and more important, risk averse CEOs may rationally invest corporate money to minimize personal risk from boycotts and walkouts. Third, large index fund managers have responded to social demand by embracing ESG activism to lure investors. Fourth, activist hedge funds target firms with ESG vulnerabilities, to later leverage them in their fight for board seats. Fifth, social demand could facilitate ESG regulation by pressuring firms to reduce lobbying activities that are not aligned with ESG goals and by tilting regulatory cost-benefit analyses in favor of ESG rules. As a result, we argue, CEOs face overwhelming, perhaps excessive, pressure to deliver on ESG goals or face career-limiting consequences. Our framework has important implications for the ESG and stakeholderism debates, for the future and desirability of ESG, and for corporate and securities law.","2023","2025-02-06 16:37:35","2025-02-06 16:37:35","","255-306","","2","28","","","","","","","","","","English","","","ABI/INFORM Collection","2865596216","","","Place: Stanford Publisher: Stanford University, Stanford Law School","","; ","https://media.proquest.com/media/hms/PFT/1/Nd7HV?_a=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&_s=GmYsnrVg4VxVHsluA0%2BvtAwGNsA%3D; https://libkey.io/libraries/3027/openurl?ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&ctx_enc=info:ofi/enc:UTF-8&rfr_id=info:sid/ProQuest&rft_val_fmt=journal&rft.genre=article&rft.jtitle=Stanford+Journal+of+Law%2C+Business+%26+Finance&rft.atitle=The+Millennial+Corporation%3A+Strong+Stakeholders%2C+Weak+Managers&rft.au=Barzuza%2C+Michal%3BCurtis%2C+Quinn%3BWebber%2C+David+H.&rft.aulast=Barzuza&rft.aufirst=Michal&rft.date=2023-04-01&rft.volume=28&rft.issue=2&rft.spage=255&rft.isbn=&rft.btitle=&rft.title=Stanford+Journal+of+Law%2C+Business+%26+Finance&rft.issn=10788794&rft_id=info:doi/","52394:Portfolio Management and Investment Advice; 52591:Open-End Investment Funds; Activism; Activists; Biophysical environment; Business And Economics--Banking And Finance; Careers; Climate change; Corporate governance; Cost benefit analysis; Directors; Economic; Employees; Hedge funds; Index funds; Investment advisors; Investors; Labor disputes; Lobbying; Management; Millennials; Regulation; Shareholder voting; Social; Social goals; Social networks; Stockholders","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The data cover 6 years of campaign and media materials from a case company with several CEO-initiated activist campaigns. Our findings from an inductive analysis contribute to CEO activism theorizing in three ways. First, we extend CEO activism conceptually by identifying five underlying activities that support a public stance: anchoring motivations, modeling action, taking agency, enduring criticism, and normalizing activism. Second, we bridge individual- and organization-level analyses by depicting how a CEO involves a company in activism through activities that justify interrelated topic frame and role frame. Third, we develop a processual model that includes the pre-stance, stance-taking, and post-stance phases and explains how the underlying activities are interrelated and follow a pattern that serves to maintain CEO activism. Accordingly, CEO activism includes activities, through the pre-stance, stance-taking, and post-stance phases, whereby a CEO deliberately engages personally and through a company in public debate about sensitive socio-political issues and the role of businesses in addressing them.","2023-03","2025-02-06 16:37:35","2025-02-06 21:08:16","","646-694","","3","62","","","","","","","","","","English","","","ABI/INFORM Collection; Sociological Abstracts","2785880708","","","Place: Chicago Publisher: SAGE PUBLICATIONS, INC.","","","https://libkey.io/libraries/3027/openurl?ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&ctx_enc=info:ofi/enc:UTF-8&rfr_id=info:sid/ProQuest&rft_val_fmt=journal&rft.genre=article&rft.jtitle=Business+and+Society&rft.atitle=A+Processual+Model+of+CEO+Activism%3A+Activities%2C+Frames%2C+and+Phases&rft.au=Olkkonen%2C+Laura%3BMorsing+Mette.&rft.aulast=Olkkonen&rft.aufirst=Laura&rft.date=2023-03-01&rft.volume=62&rft.issue=3&rft.spage=646&rft.isbn=&rft.btitle=&rft.title=Business+and+Society&rft.issn=00076503&rft_id=info:doi/10.1177%2F00076503221110184","Activism; Business And Economics; CEO activism; Chief executive officer; Chief executive officers; Companies; corporate activism; frames; Framing; Political factors; processual model; Stance","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Simultaneously, the general public is increasingly politically polarized. We examine how CEOs' support for gun control after two mass shootings differentially affected the behavior of liberal and conservative consumers and the persistence of these effects. Using mobile phone location data to measure store‐level visits, we find (a) consumer visits to stores decreased by 3%; (b) this decrease was asymmetric: visits in the most conservative counties decreased by about 5% but did not change in the most liberal counties; and (c) these effects dissipated within 10 weeks after activism. Our results highlight the strategic implications for executives pressured to take stances on controversial issues.Managerial SummaryWe study how consumers respond to CEO support for gun control, and how consumers' partisan views influence their behavior. Visits to the stores of several major retailers declined about 3% in the 4 weeks after their CEOs supported expanding background checks for gun purchases. In the most liberal counties, visits did not change following CEO support for gun control, while in the most conservative counties visits declined about 5%.

We find, however, that these effects dissipated within 10 weeks; as a result, retailers whose CEOs supported gun control did not experience any long‐term, net decrease in sales despite the short‐term sales decrease in conservative counties.","2023-03","2025-02-06 16:37:35","2025-02-06 21:08:33","","672-703","","3","44","","","","","","","","","","English","","","ABI/INFORM Collection; International Bibliography of the Social Sciences (IBSS)","2772897895","","","Place: Chicago Publisher: Wiley Periodicals Inc.","","","https://libkey.io/libraries/3027/openurl?ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&ctx_enc=info:ofi/enc:UTF-8&rfr_id=info:sid/ProQuest&rft_val_fmt=journal&rft.genre=article&rft.jtitle=Strategic+Management+Journal&rft.atitle=The+effects+of+CEO+activism%3A+Partisan+consumer+behavior+and+its+duration&rft.au=Hou%2C+Young%3BPoliquin%2C+Christopher+W.&rft.aulast=Hou&rft.aufirst=Young&rft.date=2023-03-01&rft.volume=44&rft.issue=3&rft.spage=672&rft.isbn=&rft.btitle=&rft.title=Strategic+Management+Journal&rft.issn=01432095&rft_id=info:doi/10.1002%2Fsmj.3451","Activism; Business And Economics--Management; CEO activism; Chief executive officer; Chief executives; Consumer behavior; Consumer behaviour; Consumers; Core business; Firearm laws & regulations; Firearms; General publics; Gun control; guns; Management journals; Mass murders; Mobile phones; Non-market strategy; nonmarket strategy; polarization; political consumerism; Political consumerism; Political issues; Political polarization; Sales; Social issues; Strategic management; Visits","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Ultimately, the paper seeks to arrive at a better conceptual understanding of CEO advocates and activists from a communication science perspective.Design/methodology/approachThis paper is conceptual and considers findings from the literature on personalization, reputation, issues and topic management.FindingsThe paper reflects media, receptive and strategic implications for CEO advocates and activists and derives four workable propositions. It lays the foundation for treating CEO advocacy and activism as a form of strategic topic management that harnesses personalization to address a new set of stakeholder demands.Practical implicationsThe insights gained from this paper may help researchers and practitioners understand when CEOs should speak up, what to communicate and how. The human element behind this kind of communication echoes new expectations, demands and values from stakeholders, shareholders and society at large.Social implicationsUnderstanding the specific interdependencies between personalization, reputation, issues and topic management underlying CEO advocacy and activism can help to improve a CEO's relationship with stakeholders and guide the public discourse to actively bring about positive societal change.Originality/valueThe paper fills a gap by providing an understanding of advocate and activist CEOs from a communication science perspective.

The case of the American technology industry demonstrates the limits of relying on firms to change from within. The widespread practice of awarding stock ties white-collar compensation to corporate performance and curtails employee activism. The high-tech venture capital model measures success using rapid return on investment and acquisition of market share. Corporate governance practices and dual-class shares give founder-CEOs outsized control and entrench existing business models, even when they have damaging downstream consequences. The trajectory of these purportedly purpose-driven companies indicates that, as in the past, regulation may be the most effective path to meaningful corporate reform.","2023","2025-02-06 16:37:35","2025-02-06 16:37:35","","217","","1","152","","","","","","","","","","English","","","International Bibliography of the Social Sciences (IBSS); ProQuest One Literature","2783221900","","","Place: Boston Publisher: MIT Press","","","https://libkey.io/libraries/3027/openurl?ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&ctx_enc=info:ofi/enc:UTF-8&rfr_id=info:sid/ProQuest&rft_val_fmt=journal&rft.genre=article&rft.jtitle=Daedalus&rft.atitle=Can+Firms+Act+Morally%3F&rft.au=O%27Mara%2C+Margaret.&rft.aulast=O%27Mara&rft.aufirst=Margaret&rft.date=2023-01-01&rft.volume=152&rft.issue=1&rft.spage=217&rft.isbn=&rft.btitle=&rft.title=Daedalus&rft.issn=00115266&rft_id=info:doi/10.1162%2Fdaed_a_01981","Activism; Business; Chief executive officer; Chief executives; Company; Compensation; Corporate governance; Economic; Ethics; Market shares; Morality; Political economy; Profits; Return on investment; Sciences: Comprehensive Works; Venture capital","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We find that changes in compensation in the two-year window surrounding the release of CCLs are negatively associated with the number of disclosure defects identified in CCLs, and that this association is driven by defects that relate directly to pay or the method by which it was determined, rather than broader governance- or readability-related defects. Cross-sectional analyses suggest that the negative impact of a CCL on excess CEO compensation is concentrated in firms with overpaid CEOs and less powerful CEOs. We further show that total disclosure defects, pay-related defects and governance-related defects are positively associated with the likelihood that the subject firm experiences low shareholder support in subsequent ‘say-on-pay’ votes, suggesting that enhanced visibility of excess pay and resulting shareholder activism may be one channel through which pressure is brought to bear on firms to reduce excess compensation.","2022-12","2025-02-06 16:37:35","2025-02-06 21:08:31","","1089-1118","","5","31","","","","","","","","","","English","","","ABI/INFORM Collection; International Bibliography of the Social Sciences (IBSS)","2746712802","","","Place: London Publisher: Taylor & Francis Ltd.","","","https://libkey.io/libraries/3027/openurl?ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&ctx_enc=info:ofi/enc:UTF-8&rfr_id=info:sid/ProQuest&rft_val_fmt=journal&rft.genre=article&rft.jtitle=European+Accounting+Review&rft.atitle=SEC+Compensation-related+Comment+Letters+and+Excess+CEO+Compensation&rft.au=Wang%2C+Weixiao%3BZhang%2C+Lijuan%3BWilson%2C+Mark%3BTejshree+Kala.&rft.aulast=Wang&rft.aufirst=Weixiao&rft.date=2022-12-01&rft.volume=31&rft.issue=5&rft.spage=1089&rft.isbn=&rft.btitle=&rft.title=European+Accounting+Review&rft.issn=09638180&rft_id=info:doi/10.1080%2F09638180.2022.2046120","Business And Economics--Accounting; Chief executive officer; Chief executive officers; Chief executives; Compensation; Corporate Disclosure; Corporate Governance; Excess Compensation; Executive compensation; Executive Compensation; Governance; Readability; SEC Comment Letters; Stockholders; Visibility","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We examine how Chief Executive Officer (CEO) gender influences retail investors' responses to proxy contests. We find that these investors are more likely to support-through their proxy voting behavior-campaigns that target female-led versus male-led firms, despite the fact that retail investors evaluate female and male CEOs similarly. We show that this apparent discrepancy is a function of how subjective ratings mask stereotype-influenced judgments, consistent with the shifting standards model (SSM). Respondents use lower standards to evaluate female versus male CEOs. This difference becomes apparent when externally-anchored judgments are employed, such as when investors are asked to choose sides in a proxy contest. Correspondingly, activists are judged as relatively more competent when targeting female-led firms. Our findings contribute to research on CEO gender and activism. In doing so, our research also introduces the SSM to the investor decision-making literature, thereby enriching the discussion about what mechanisms underpin the less favorable investment outcomes female-led firms can experience.

However, self-serving attribution was not identified as a significant mediator. Furthermore, though transparent leadership communication was not significantly associated with self-serving attribution, the latter was positively related to both issue advocacy intention and company advocacy intention.

We find strong support for this prediction using 15 years of data on the S&P 1,500 firms and an instrument based on director age at time of hire. We also find that an LTID adds more value to firms that are complex or mature, had more CEOs during the LTID's tenure, and have less entrenched management. Post hoc analyses of director deaths and shareholder class action lawsuits and activist motions provide additional evidence that LTIDs add value to the firms on whose boards they serve.Managerial SummaryWe study whether having a long‐tenured independent director (LTID) on the board has implications for firm performance. In general, we find that firms with an LTID perform better than firms without one. The performance benefits accrue primarily to firms that have complex operations, are in the mature stage of their lifecycle, and had more CEOs during the LTID's tenure. That said, firms with entrenched management do not benefit from having an LTID. We also find that firms with an LTID experience fewer class action lawsuits and shareholder activist motions and that the stock market reacts adversely to the death of an LTID. Overall, the evidence is that LTIDs offer valuable experience and stability to the firms on whose boards they serve.","2022-08","2025-02-06 16:37:35","2025-02-06 21:08:30","","1602-1634","","8","43","","","","","","","","","","English","","","ABI/INFORM Collection; International Bibliography of the Social Sciences (IBSS)","2690659535","","","Place: Chicago Publisher: Wiley Periodicals Inc.","","","https://libkey.io/libraries/3027/openurl?ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&ctx_enc=info:ofi/enc:UTF-8&rfr_id=info:sid/ProQuest&rft_val_fmt=journal&rft.genre=article&rft.jtitle=Strategic+Management+Journal&rft.atitle=Long%E2%80%90tenured+independent+directors+and+firm+performance&rft.au=Bonini%2C+Stefano%3BDeng%2C+Justin%3BFerrari%2C+Mascia%3BKose%2C+John%3BDavid+Gaddis+Ross.&rft.aulast=Bonini&rft.aufirst=Stefano&rft.date=2022-08-01&rft.volume=43&rft.issue=8&rft.spage=1602&rft.isbn=&rft.btitle=&rft.title=Strategic+Management+Journal&rft.issn=01432095&rft_id=info:doi/10.1002%2Fsmj.3370","Activists; Board; boards; Business And Economics--Management; Chief executive officer; Chief executives; Class action lawsuits; Companies; Complex operations; corporate governance; Corporate governance; Director; firm performance; Firm Performance; Independent directors; Life cycle; Litigation; Motivation; Organizational performance; Performance benefits; Scandals; Securities markets; Shareholders; Stockholders; tenure; Tenure","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Yet more and more CEOs are taking visible public stands on hotly contested issues, engaging in what has come to be called CEO sociopolitical activism. Despite its growing prevalence and potentially major implications, this class of executive behaviors remains largely unexplored by organizational scholars. Our study tests and elaborates on stakeholder alignment theory to investigate the influence of CEO activism on employees’ attitudes and behaviors, particularly its effects on employees’ organizational commitment and support for the ideology underpinning the CEO’s public stance. Our theoretical predictions hinge on the degree of alignment between the CEO’s stance and the prevailing ideological tilt of the employee population, as well as the degree to which employees view the CEO as a credible leader. We test our ideas in the context of a highly publicized letter signed by nearly 100 public company CEOs in opposition to North Carolina’s controversial 2016 “bathroom bill.” Relying on multiple data sources to examine differences between firms whose CEOs signed the letter and firms whose CEOs declined the invitation to sign, we find general support for our theory, indicating that CEO activism has important intra- and extra-firm implications.","2022-06","2025-02-06 16:37:35","2025-02-06 21:08:28","","553-593","","2","67","","","","","","","","","","English","","","ABI/INFORM Collection; International Bibliography of the Social Sciences (IBSS); ProQuest One Psychology; Sociological Abstracts; Worldwide Political Science Abstracts","2665519943","","","Place: Thousand Oaks Publisher: SAGE PUBLICATIONS, INC.","","","https://libkey.io/libraries/3027/openurl?ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&ctx_enc=info:ofi/enc:UTF-8&rfr_id=info:sid/ProQuest&rft_val_fmt=journal&rft.genre=article&rft.jtitle=Administrative+Science+Quarterly&rft.atitle=How+Do+Employees+React+When+Their+CEO+Speaks+Out%3F+Intra-+and+Extra-Firm+Implications+of+CEO+Sociopolitical+Activism&rft.au=Wowak%2C+Adam+J%3BBusenbark%2C+John+R%3BHambrick%2C+Donald+C.&rft.aulast=Wowak&rft.aufirst=Adam&rft.date=2022-06-01&rft.volume=67&rft.issue=2&rft.spage=553&rft.isbn=&rft.btitle=&rft.title=Administrative+Science+Quarterly&rft.issn=00018392&rft_id=info:doi/10.1177%2F00018392221078584","Activism; Behavior; CEO prototypicality; CEO regard; Chief executive officer; chief executive officers (CEOs); Chief executives; Employee attitude; Employees; Executives (Business); Ideology; Letters (Correspondence); Organization theory; Organizational commitment; organizational political ideology; Political ideologies; political ideology; Sociology; sociopolitical activism; Sociopolitical factors; stakeholders; State laws","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Implicit motives are motivational dispositions that operate outside of an individual's conscious awareness. We find that CEOs' implicit needs for achievement and power are associated with a decrease in competitive intensity following short seller activism, implying that implicit motives can lead CEOs to avoid behaviors that they fear may result in failure or the exposure of weakness in the wake of an external threat.

[...]the U.S. appears to be shifting towards a leadership structure more in-line with other countries around the world (Garcia-Castro et al., 2008). Ghosh, Karuna, and Tian (2015, 197) state there is ""no evidence to suggest that CEO-Chairs use their power from holding dual positions to the detriment of shareholders."" [...]the operating environment appears to determine whether the firm has CEO duality or not (e.g., Dey, Engel, and Liu, 2011; Ghosh et al., 2015), indicating that firms select the best leadership structure for achieving objectives. [...]we extend the literature by examining: (1) the drivers (i.e., firm characteristics) that increase or decrease the likelihood of a shareholder proposal (to end CEO duality) at the annual meeting; (2) how these drivers influence the outcome of the vote tally; and (3) the consequences - whether the proposal passed or not. [...]our analysis reveals that a vote on a proposal to end CEO duality is generally associated with improved future financial performance, but the outcome depends on how the firm responds to the vote.","2022","2025-02-06 16:37:35","2025-02-06 16:37:35","","1-39","","1","13","","","","","","","","","","English","","","ABI/INFORM Collection","2903629506","","","Place: Upland Publisher: Pan-Pacific Business Research Institute","","; ","https://media.proquest.com/media/hms/PFT/1/CmxjW?_a=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%2BgIBToIDA1dlYooDHENJRDoyMDI1MDIwNjE2MDgzMzEzOToxMTg1MDM%3D&_s=s2eGWwxsKZTLwRlDHBDoz8xJfVY%3D; https://libkey.io/libraries/3027/openurl?ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&ctx_enc=info:ofi/enc:UTF-8&rfr_id=info:sid/ProQuest&rft_val_fmt=journal&rft.genre=article&rft.jtitle=Pan+-+Pacific+Journal+of+Business+Research&rft.atitle=Shareholders+of+U.S.+Corporations+Voting+to+End+CEO+Duality%3A+Why+and+are+there+any+consequences%3F&rft.au=Munsif%2C+Vishal%3BSinghvi%2C+Ankita.&rft.aulast=Munsif&rft.aufirst=Vishal&rft.date=2022-04-01&rft.volume=13&rft.issue=1&rft.spage=1&rft.isbn=&rft.btitle=&rft.title=Pan+-+Pacific+Journal+of+Business+Research&rft.issn=&rft_id=info:doi/","Boards of directors; Business And Economics; Chief executive officers; Corporate governance; Executive compensation; Shareholder; Shareholder activism; Shareholder meetings; Shareholder voting; United States; United States--US","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In particular, corporate statements that directly address the issues around the protests are identified and possible mechanisms underlying how these may impact shareholder value are discussed.Design/methodology/approach>The authors first use a qualitative research approach of content and sentiment analysis to track how companies or their chief executive officers (CEOs) present their stance against racial injustice, as represented by their use of linguistic markers. Then, the authors use an event study methodology to assess the response from stock market participants.Findings>The findings suggest that CEOs primarily convey their stance using language that is emotive and empathic. In addition, shareholders earn a significant abnormal return of 2.13%, on average, in the three days following the release of the statements.Research limitations/implications>This study considered only US-listed companies. The sample size, also, is relatively small. Institutional and cultural differences across countries may also vary. Thus, future research could explore the extent to which the findings generalize to other contexts.Practical implications>Results provide insights to top managers who communicate with various stakeholders on emotionally charged social issues. Findings also offer insights on the timing of trades for investors and arbitrageurs.Social implications>Findings contribute to the understanding of corporate behaviour in times of social upheaval. Insights from the study may also be used to inform corporate communication decisions about important social issues.Originality/value>This study brings into focus the role that affective appeal and moral emotion can play in evoking motivation for corporate activism, and the impact that this has on investor opinions’ formation process.","2022","2025-02-06 16:37:35","2025-02-06 21:08:22","","236-256","","2","17","","","","","","","","","","English","","","ABI/INFORM Collection; Sociological Abstracts","2643935438","","","Place: Bradford Publisher: Emerald Group Publishing Limited","","; ","https://media.proquest.com/media/hms/PFT/1/kIZPM?_a=ChgyMDI1MDIwNjE2MTUwMDU2NTo5NDExNTcSBjEwMjEyNhoKT05FX1NFQVJDSCIPMTI4LjE3OS4xNTQuMjQzKgUyODM1NDIKMjY0MzkzNTQzODoNRG9jdW1lbnRJbWFnZUIBMFIGT25saW5lWgJGVGIDUEZUagoyMDIyLzA0LzAxcgoyMDIyLzA2LzMwegCCASlQLTEwMDAwMDEtMTIwMDYtQ1VTVE9NRVItMTAwMDAwMDgtMTgwNjk2OJIBBk9ubGluZcoBdU1vemlsbGEvNS4wIChNYWNpbnRvc2g7IEludGVsIE1hYyBPUyBYIDEwXzE1XzcpIEFwcGxlV2ViS2l0LzUzNy4zNiAoS0hUTUwsIGxpa2UgR2Vja28pIENocm9tZS8xMzEuMC4wLjAgU2FmYXJpLzUzNy4zNtIBElNjaG9sYXJseSBKb3VybmFsc5oCB1ByZVBhaWSqAitPUzpFTVMtTWVkaWFMaW5rc1NlcnZpY2UtZ2V0TWVkaWFVcmxGb3JJdGVtygIPQXJ0aWNsZXxGZWF0dXJl0gIBWfICAPoCAU6CAwNXZWKKAxxDSUQ6MjAyNTAyMDYxNjA4MzMxMzk6MTE4NTAz&_s=Jv0Mdy3f3gApYXzvzvi%2FsodOIoo%3D; https://libkey.io/libraries/3027/openurl?ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&ctx_enc=info:ofi/enc:UTF-8&rfr_id=info:sid/ProQuest&rft_val_fmt=journal&rft.genre=article&rft.jtitle=Society+and+Business+Review&rft.atitle=CEO+statements+on+racial+inequity+%26ndash%3B+%28how%29+do+they+matter+to+shareholders%3F&rft.au=Afego%2C+Pyemo%3BAlagidede%2C+Imhotep.&rft.aulast=Afego&rft.aufirst=Pyemo&rft.date=2022-04-01&rft.volume=17&rft.issue=2&rft.spage=236&rft.isbn=&rft.btitle=&rft.title=Society+and+Business+Review&rft.issn=17465680&rft_id=info:doi/10.1108%2FSBR-02-2021-0031","81331:Social Advocacy Organizations; Abnormal returns; Activism; Advocacy; Affective empathy; Animal rights movement; Brand loyalty; CEO activism; Chief executive officer; Chief executive officers; Communication; Companies; Content and sentiment analysis; Corporate communication; Cultural differences; Decision making; Decision theory; Demonstrations & protests; Emotions; Emotive language; Empathy; Event study; Health care policy; Inequality; Investments; Language; Linguistics; Political activism; Public interest; Purchase intention; Qualitative research; Racial injustice; Racial justice; Same sex marriage; Securities markets; Sentiment analysis; Shareholder; Shareholder value; Social activism; Social inequality; Social interaction; Sociology; Stockholders; United States--US; Value","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In consequence, 1,146 lead themes were derived and studied in an in-depth qualitative analysis by deploying a pattern-inducing method.Findings>Research on CEO activism can be placed on a time-oriented logic, giving insights into the realisation of activism, stakeholder reactions, moderators and perception effects.

Thereby, it proposes communicative planning from activism’s realisation to its perceptual results.Originality/value>The study provides a holistic view of CEO activism as a starting point for further discussion.

This paper examines whether this form of engagement mitigates activism that relies upon support from other shareholders. We find that IR engagement is associated with increased investor confidence in management and the board, as well as a lower likelihood of activism, with this deterrent effect becoming stronger when there are fewer frictions surrounding the development of mutual understanding and trust with investors. We also find that when firms do experience an activist campaign, firms with IR engagement have less costly and contentious campaigns, including a lower likelihood of CEO turnover, than those without such a commitment. Taken together, our findings suggest that direct and ongoing IR engagement is an important factor in achieving mutual understanding and trust between the firm and its shareholders, which deters activist investors and mitigates the costly escalation of initiated campaigns.","2022-03","2025-02-06 16:37:35","2025-02-06 16:37:35","","77","","2","97","","","","","","","","","","English","","","ABI/INFORM Collection; International Bibliography of the Social Sciences (IBSS)","2642939463","","","Place: Sarasota Publisher: American Accounting Association","","","https://libkey.io/libraries/3027/openurl?ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&ctx_enc=info:ofi/enc:UTF-8&rfr_id=info:sid/ProQuest&rft_val_fmt=journal&rft.genre=article&rft.jtitle=The+Accounting+Review&rft.atitle=Investor+Relations%2C+Engagement%2C+and+Shareholder+Activism&rft.au=Chapman%2C+Kimball+L%3BMiller%2C+Gregory+S%3BNeilson%2C+Jed+J%3BWhite%2C+Hal+D.&rft.aulast=Chapman&rft.aufirst=Kimball&rft.date=2022-03-01&rft.volume=97&rft.issue=2&rft.spage=77&rft.isbn=&rft.btitle=&rft.title=The+Accounting+Review&rft.issn=00014826&rft_id=info:doi/10.2308%2FTAR-2018-0361","52394:Portfolio Management and Investment Advice; 52591:Open-End Investment Funds; 52599:Other Financial Vehicles; Activism; Activists; Campaigns; Education; Engagement; Investor; Investor relations; Investors; Mutual funds; Shareholder; Shareholder activism; Shareholder relations; Stockholders; Trust","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The executive’s agility to react to financial distress determines the probability of bankruptcy. Proper governance drives sound and sustainable, value maximising decision-making, while inept practices lead to value diminishing, self-serving behaviour that financially constrains companies, resulting in an acceleration of financial distress. This study examined the correlation between financial distress and corporate governance within a sample of 116 listed South African companies using the GMM estimation. Key financial distress determinants were found to be audit committees and shareholder activism (proxied by equity ownership) that may deter investor apathy, “director opportunism” and CEO dominance. Also, long-tenured CEOs and post-graduate directors possess contextually enriched latent knowledge that may assist distressed firms, particularly if the trade-offs between director’s remuneration and governance is well managed. Furthermore, the K-score model served as a robust financial distress proxy since it allowed the interrogation of grey zone companies. These findings provided financial distress determinants aiding decision-making for ailing businesses to avoid liquidation, which can be of use to regulatory bodies and policymakers in developing sustainable governance strategies.","2022-01","2025-02-06 16:37:35","2025-02-06 21:08:18","","","","1","10","","","","","","","","","","English","","","ABI/INFORM Collection; International Bibliography of the Social Sciences (IBSS); Publicly Available Content Database","2770809046","","","Place: London Publisher: Taylor & Francis Ltd.","","; ","https://media.proquest.com/media/hms/PFT/1/OnM8U?_a=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%2BgIBWYIDA1dlYooDHENJRDoyMDI1MDIwNjE2MDgzMzEzOToxMTg1MDM%3D&_s=17mkoJ%2Fsbp%2FsAAWLqDpe2q8GaGc%3D; https://libkey.io/libraries/3027/openurl?ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&ctx_enc=info:ofi/enc:UTF-8&rfr_id=info:sid/ProQuest&rft_val_fmt=journal&rft.genre=article&rft.jtitle=Cogent+Economics+%26+Finance&rft.atitle=An+econometric+analysis+of+financial+distress+determinants+from+an+emerging+economy+governance+perspective&rft.au=Navitha+Singh+Sewpersadh.&rft.aulast=Navitha+Singh+Sewpersadh&rft.aufirst=&rft.date=2022-01-01&rft.volume=10&rft.issue=1&rft.spage=&rft.isbn=&rft.btitle=&rft.title=Cogent+Economics+%26+Finance&rft.issn=&rft_id=info:doi/10.1080%2F23322039.2021.1978706","Activism; Agency; Apathy; Audit committees; Bankruptcy; Business And Economics; CEO; Chief executives; Companies; corporate governance; Corporate governance; Decision making; directors; Dominance; Economic; Emerging market; Finance; financial distress; Financial distress; Ownership; Policy making; Psychological distress; Regulatory agencies; shareholder activism; South Africa; Stockholders; Sustainability; Value","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, studies focusing on the way shareholder activists affect top managers’ cognition are still in its infancy. Thus, this study examines the relationship between shareholder activism and chief executive officers’ (CEOs’) future focus on the basis of signaling theory. By applying a contingency view and considering various characteristics of proposals by activists as pivotal moderators, it intends to reveal the conditions under which activists stimulate CEOs’ future focus. Empirical analyses not only confirm that shareholder activism shapes CEOs’ future focus but also reveal that this effect is stronger when shareholder proposals are written in an analytical and powerful tone, contain more adverbs and verbs, and trigger CEOs’ cognition by highlighting negativity. Conversely, more self-related proposals reduce activists’ positive impact. Supplemental analyses indicate that the relationship between shareholder activism and CEOs’ future focus may vary under the different characteristics of the boards of directors. Generally, the study provides an innovative and more ‘humanized’ perspective on the literature being among the first to examine the impact of shareholder activism on CEOs’ future focus based on signaling theory. By exploring communication characteristics, the study also applies a relatively novel lens in management research. Moreover, it offers valuable practical implications for shareholders (proposals as effective means to increase interest alignment between shareholders and top-level executives), CEOs (proposals as an impetus to become more aware of future events), and boards of directors (proposals as an important governance tool).","2022-03","2025-02-06 16:37:35","2025-02-06 16:37:35","","255-286","","1","26","","","","","","","","","","English","","","ABI/INFORM Collection; International Bibliography of the Social Sciences (IBSS)","2644596297","","","Place: Dordrecht Publisher: Springer Nature B.V.","","; ","https://media.proquest.com/media/hms/PFT/1/5smQM?_a=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&_s=J9WavNGQfoSA5Uu2B46jLBT31K4%3D; https://libkey.io/libraries/3027/openurl?ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&ctx_enc=info:ofi/enc:UTF-8&rfr_id=info:sid/ProQuest&rft_val_fmt=journal&rft.genre=article&rft.jtitle=Journal+of+Management+%26+Governance&rft.atitle=Shaping+CEOs%26rsquo%3B+future+focus+through+shareholder+activism%3A+the+role+of+proposal+characteristics&rft.au=Back%2C+Pascal%3BColombo+Oskar.&rft.aulast=Back&rft.aufirst=Pascal&rft.date=2022-01-01&rft.volume=26&rft.issue=1&rft.spage=255&rft.isbn=&rft.btitle=&rft.title=Journal+of+Management+%26+Governance&rft.issn=13853457&rft_id=info:doi/10.1007%2Fs10997-020-09540-y","Activism; Activists; Board of directors; Boards of directors; Business And Economics--Banking And Finance; Chief executive officer; Chief executive officers; Chief executives; Cognition; Communication; Executives; Future; Governance; Infancy; Linguistics; Moderators; Proposal; Proposals; Shareholder activism; Signaling theory; Signalling theory; Stockholders; Temporal focus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The upswing in financialization since the 1970s has coincided with the steady accumulation of long-term retirement savings and their consolidation in institutional capital pools. Pension fund demand for high-yield, long-term financial claims has acted as a catalyst for financialization, understood as the reorganization of ownership relations and economic activity in ways that serve the needs of institutional capital pools. In the driver’s seat of this reorganization sits a financial sector whose primary function has shifted from financing investment to preserving wealth, along with a shift in institutional form from banks to asset managers. Under this “asset manager capitalism,” the dominant figures on Wall Street are no longer the CEOs of the big banks but figures such as Larry Fink or Stephen Schwarzman, the CEOs of BlackRock and Blackstone, respectively. Asset managers’ power is most visible vis-à-vis listed corporations—that is, in corporate governance—but it reaches much further. Closely held companies, residential real estate, infrastructure, land—there is no sector that asset managers have not made accessible for financial capital and where they do not exercise substantial structural power, often through outright control. For labor, the consequences of financialization and the rise of asset manager capitalism have been dire. Countless empirical studies have documented correlations between various measures of financialization, such as payouts to shareholders, and various measures of income and wealth inequality, such as wages.2 At the same time, ever since Peter Drucker’s warning of the coming of “pension fund socialism” was countered by Jeremy Rifkin and Randy Barber’s positive vision of labor’s capital as an instrument of labor power, the latter has gripped the imagination of scholars and labor organizers.3 Indeed, the past two decades have seen an impressive increase in pro-worker activism by public-sector and multi-employer, collectively bargained plans known as Taft-Hartley pension funds, and a lively debate is taking place about the prospects for “capital stewardship” to deliver results for U.S. workers.4 In this context, I argue that the ongoing debate about meso-level prospects for labor’s capital under-appreciates the macro-level consequences of U.S. funded pensions as the world’s single most consequential financializing force over the past half-century.","2022-01","2025-02-06 16:37:35","2025-02-06 16:37:35","","70-79","","1","31","","","","","","","","","","English","","","PAIS Index","2615717145","","","Place: Abingdon Publisher: Sage Publications Ltd.","","","https://libkey.io/libraries/3027/openurl?ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&ctx_enc=info:ofi/enc:UTF-8&rfr_id=info:sid/ProQuest&rft_val_fmt=journal&rft.genre=article&rft.jtitle=New+Labor+Forum&rft.atitle=Fueling+Financialization%3A+The+Economic+Consequences+of+Funded+Pensions&rft.au=Braun%2C+Benjamin.&rft.aulast=Braun&rft.aufirst=Benjamin&rft.date=2022-01-01&rft.volume=31&rft.issue=1&rft.spage=70&rft.isbn=&rft.btitle=&rft.title=New+Labor+Forum&rft.issn=10957960&rft_id=info:doi/10.1177%2F10957960211062218","asset manager capitalism; Banking; capital stewardship; Capitalism; Companies; Economic activity; Employers; Executives (Business); Financial services; financialization; Gross Domestic Product--GDP; Income inequality; Labor Unions; labor’s capital; Ownership; pension funds; Pension funds; Pensions; Power; Real estate; Reorganization; Retirement; Stockholders; United States--US; Wall Street; Wealth distribution; Workers","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

I seek to develop an initial understanding of this phenomenon by examining some of the critical consequences of CEOs’ public responses to social activist challenges. Drawing on instrumental stakeholder theory and social movement theory, I recognize the dualistic nature of CEOs’ public responses to social activist challenges; that is, a single response can influence both the direct pressure received from the focal social activists confronting the firm as well as the potential pressure the firm could face in the form of additional challenges. I argue that a CEO’s accommodative public response—seen by social activists as a sign that the CEO and firm are aligned with their beliefs, values, and motivations—will be negatively associated with the focal social activists’ willingness to punish the firm. At the same time, however, a CEO’s accommodative public response sends a broader signal—reflective of the CEO and firm’s relative openness to social activism and social issues—that will be positively associated with the perceived attractiveness of the firm’s corporate opportunity structure for social activism, increasing the potential for the firm to receive additional social activist challenges. I conduct a laboratory experiment based on a real-life case and find support for my arguments. The results yield important implications for research on strategic leadership, stakeholder strategy, and social movements.","2022-01","2025-02-06 16:37:35","2025-02-06 21:08:27","","45-80","","1","61","","","","","","","","","","English","","","ABI/INFORM Collection; Sociological Abstracts","2607553806","","","Place: Chicago Publisher: SAGE PUBLICATIONS, INC.","","","https://libkey.io/libraries/3027/openurl?ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&ctx_enc=info:ofi/enc:UTF-8&rfr_id=info:sid/ProQuest&rft_val_fmt=journal&rft.genre=article&rft.jtitle=Business+and+Society&rft.atitle=Examining+the+Conflicting+Consequences+of+CEO+Public+Responses+to+Social+Activist+Challenges&rft.au=Neville%2C+Fran%C3%A7ois.&rft.aulast=Neville&rft.aufirst=Fran%C3%A7ois&rft.date=2022-01-01&rft.volume=61&rft.issue=1&rft.spage=45&rft.isbn=&rft.btitle=&rft.title=Business+and+Society&rft.issn=00076503&rft_id=info:doi/10.1177%2F0007650320963607","Activism; Activists; Business And Economics; CEO; laboratory experiment; Leadership; opportunity structure; social activism; Social activism; Social movement; Social movements; Social response; stakeholder strategy; strategic leadership; Strategic leadership; Strategic management","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We argue that institutional pressure and the characteristics of the firm affect choices around environmental strategies. An empirical analysis of 597 heavily polluting firms indicates that more firms choose environmental leadership strategies, which means that they actively work with upstream and downstream firms to reduce emissions, when government pressure is the greatest; however, more companies are likely to choose pollution prevention strategies, which implies recycling materials in the production process is implemented, when public pressure is the greatest. Finally, organisations with more redundant resources and strong asset specificity are more prone to choose environmental leadership strategies as policy pressure or public pressure increases. The findings offer a decision-making framework to promote environmental measures related to government policy formulation and public participation. The results can also provide empirical evidence to guide environmental strategic choices for heavily polluting enterprises.","2022-01","2025-02-06 16:37:35","2025-02-06 16:37:35","","7614-7626","","5","29","","","","","","","","","","English","","","MEDLINE®","2569383168; 34476710","","","","","","https://libkey.io/libraries/3027/openurl?ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&ctx_enc=info:ofi/enc:UTF-8&rfr_id=info:sid/ProQuest&rft_val_fmt=journal&rft.genre=article&rft.jtitle=Environmental+science+and+pollution+research+international&rft.atitle=Heterogeneous+choices+of+environmental+strategies+for+heavily+polluting+firms+under+institutional+pressure+in+China.&rft.au=Wang%2C+Sen%3BYin%2C+Jianhua%3BZhu%2C+Xiaomei.&rft.aulast=Wang&rft.aufirst=Sen&rft.date=2022-01-01&rft.volume=29&rft.issue=5&rft.spage=7614&rft.isbn=&rft.btitle=&rft.title=Environmental+science+and+pollution+research+international&rft.issn=1614-7499&rft_id=info:doi/10.1007%2Fs11356-021-16090-9","Asset specificity; China; Environmental Pollution; Environmental strategy; Government; Index Medicus; Industry; Organisational slack; Policy; Policy pressure; Public pressure","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This study assesses the impact of CEO activism on shareholder value and investigates potential drivers behind the decision to advocate. We conduct an event study centred on a particular episode of CEO activism: the resignation of a group of business leaders from their roles as advisors to President Trump. We choose this setting since activism is likely to have a stronger impact when a CEO is politically connected. However, by engaging in advocacy, a CEO risks severing the very same political links that underlie the strength of the message. We find that shareholders react negatively to the decision to quit a presidential advisory council, which is consistent with a fear of weakening their firm's political influence. The decision to publicly advocate seems to be driven more by a CEO's personal political ideology than by a company's general involvement in corporate social responsibility. We also observe that managers are more likely to take a stand when they are protected by their firm's corporate governance rules. This study provides empirical evidence of the risks associated with CEO activism.","2021-10","2025-02-06 16:37:36","2025-02-06 21:08:36","","1062-1081","","4","32","","","","","","","","","","English","","","ABI/INFORM Collection; International Bibliography of the Social Sciences (IBSS)","2579316187","","","Place: London Publisher: Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","","","https://libkey.io/libraries/3027/openurl?ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&ctx_enc=info:ofi/enc:UTF-8&rfr_id=info:sid/ProQuest&rft_val_fmt=journal&rft.genre=article&rft.jtitle=British+Journal+of+Management&rft.atitle=To+Advocate+or+Not+to+Advocate%3A+Determinants+and+Financial+Consequences+of+CEO+Activism&rft.au=Mascia+Bedendo%3BSiming%2C+Linus.&rft.aulast=Mascia+Bedendo&rft.aufirst=&rft.date=2021-10-01&rft.volume=32&rft.issue=4&rft.spage=1062&rft.isbn=&rft.btitle=&rft.title=British+Journal+of+Management&rft.issn=10453172&rft_id=info:doi/10.1111%2F1467-8551.12459","Activism; Advocacy; Business; Business And Economics--Management; Chief executive officer; Chief executive officers; Chief executives; Corporate governance; Corporate social responsibility; Ideology; Political activism; Political ideologies; Political power; Shareholder value; Social responsibility; Stockholders","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Shareholder activism increases the nontarget firm's outside option and reduces the nontarget CEO's outside option. This leads to higher profit and lower CEO compensation at the nontarget firm. Due to this positive spillover, the activist's intervention is inefficiently low. As CEO talents become more transferable, monitoring, and performance improve more and CEO compensation decreases more at the nontarget firm; shareholder activism becomes less efficient due to the increased linkage between CEOs.

Critical perspectives on these new partnerships tend to frame them as an instance of market transgressions by tech giants into the sphere of health and medicine, in line with a ""hostile worlds"" doctrine that upholds that the borders between market and non-market spheres should be carefully policed. This article seeks to outline the limitations of this common framing for critically understanding the phenomenon of the Googlization of health. In particular, the mobilization of a diversity of non-market value statements in the justification work carried out by actors involved in the Googlization of health indicates the co-presence of additional worlds or spheres in this context, which are not captured by the market vs. non-market dichotomy. It then advances an alternative framework, based on a multiple-sphere ontology that draws on Boltanski and Thevenot's orders of worth and Michael Walzer's theory of justice, which I call a normative pragmatics of justice. This framework addresses both the normative deficit in Boltanski and Thevenot's work and provides an important emphasis on the empirical workings of justice. Finally, I discuss why this framework is better equipped to identify and to address the many risks raised by the Googlization of health and possibly other dimensions of the digitalization and datafication of society.","2021-09","2025-02-06 16:37:36","2025-02-06 16:37:36","","315-327","","3","24","","","","","","","","","","English","","","MEDLINE®","2501852016; 33721157","","","","","","https://libkey.io/libraries/3027/openurl?ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&ctx_enc=info:ofi/enc:UTF-8&rfr_id=info:sid/ProQuest&rft_val_fmt=journal&rft.genre=article&rft.jtitle=Medicine%2C+health+care%2C+and+philosophy&rft.atitle=From+hostile+worlds+to+multiple+spheres%3A+towards+a+normative+pragmatics+of+justice+for+the+Googlization+of+health.&rft.au=Sharon%2C+Tamar.&rft.aulast=Sharon&rft.aufirst=Tamar&rft.date=2021-09-01&rft.volume=24&rft.issue=3&rft.spage=315&rft.isbn=&rft.btitle=&rft.title=Medicine%2C+health+care%2C+and+philosophy&rft.issn=1572-8633&rft_id=info:doi/10.1007%2Fs11019-021-10006-7","Commodification; Datafication; Digital health; Googlization of health; Humans; Index Medicus; Orders of worth; Public Health; Social Justice; Spheres of justice","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We find that firm fundamentals, the existence of a ""glass cliff,"" gender discrimination bias, and hedge fund activists' inherent characteristics do not explain the observed gender effect. We also find that the transformational leadership style of female CEOs is a plausible explanation for this gender effect: instead of being self-defensive, female CEOs are more likely to communicate and cooperate with hedge fund activists to achieve intervention goals. Finally, we find that female-led targets experience greater increases in market and operational performance subsequent to hedge fund targeting.","2021-07","2025-02-06 16:37:36","2025-02-06 21:08:25","","372","","1","141","","","","","","","","","","English","","","ABI/INFORM Collection; International Bibliography of the Social Sciences (IBSS)","2550523243","","","Place: Amsterdam Publisher: Elsevier Sequoia S.A.","","","https://libkey.io/libraries/3027/openurl?ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&ctx_enc=info:ofi/enc:UTF-8&rfr_id=info:sid/ProQuest&rft_val_fmt=journal&rft.genre=article&rft.jtitle=Journal+of+Financial+Economics&rft.atitle=Do+activist+hedge+funds+target+female+CEOs%3F+The+role+of+CEO+gender+in+hedge+fund+activism&rft.au=Francis%2C+Bill+B%3BHasan%2C+Iftekhar%3BShen%2C+Yinjie+%28Victor%29%3BWu%2C+Qiang.&rft.aulast=Francis&rft.aufirst=Bill&rft.date=2021-07-01&rft.volume=141&rft.issue=1&rft.spage=372&rft.isbn=&rft.btitle=&rft.title=Journal+of+Financial+Economics&rft.issn=0304405X&rft_id=info:doi/10.1016%2Fj.jfineco.2020.07.019","52394:Portfolio Management and Investment Advice; Activism; Activists; Bias; Business And Economics; Chief executive officer; Chief executive officers; Chief executives; Collaborative communication; Cooperation; Female CEOs; Females; Gender; Gender differences; Gender equity; Hedge fund activism; Hedge funds; Leadership style; Sex discrimination; Transformational leadership; Transformational leadership style; Women","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Armed with the instrument, this paper estimates firm's distribution, managerial compensation and investment policies in response to a change in the perceived likelihood of HFA interventions.FindingsAn increase in the HFA intervention likelihood leads to increases in shareholder distribution, decreases in CEO pay and investments and increases in operating performance. Compared to the sample average, a one standard deviation increase in the intervention likelihood leads to a 9.29% increase in the firm's payout ratio, a 7.42% decrease in CEO compensation, a 2.67% decrease in capital expenditures and a 4.96% decrease in R&D expenses. These changes are consistent with the threat of intervention curbing managerial empire-building behaviors and improving firm operation. The relationships are causal, significant and robust to a variety of alternative specifications and sample divisions.Originality/valueResults of this paper suggest that as a mechanism for corporate governance, the threat of HFA is effective in preventing corporate policy deviations. They also demonstrate a stronger and broader impact of HFA on corporate policy than previously documented. By showing that HFA is an effective and viable mechanism for corporate governance, this study allows policymakers to make more informed decisions to whether increase hedge fund regulations or not.","2021-04","2025-02-06 16:37:36","2025-02-06 21:08:35","","401-415","","3","17","","","","","","","","","","English","","","ABI/INFORM Collection","2526100441","","","Place: Bradford Publisher: Emerald Group Publishing Limited","","; ","https://media.proquest.com/media/hms/PFT/1/nqADJ?_a=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&_s=2EmPHHXupHapzBx6WcPQZT0WqEs%3D; https://libkey.io/libraries/3027/openurl?ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&ctx_enc=info:ofi/enc:UTF-8&rfr_id=info:sid/ProQuest&rft_val_fmt=journal&rft.genre=article&rft.jtitle=International+Journal+of+Managerial+Finance&rft.atitle=The+preventive+effect+of+hedge+fund+activism%3A+investment%2C+CEO+compensation+and+payout+policies&rft.au=Zhu%2C+Caroline+Heqing.&rft.aulast=Zhu&rft.aufirst=Caroline&rft.date=2021-05-01&rft.volume=17&rft.issue=3&rft.spage=401&rft.isbn=&rft.btitle=&rft.title=International+Journal+of+Managerial+Finance&rft.issn=17439132&rft_id=info:doi/10.1108%2FIJMF-04-2020-0181","52394:Portfolio Management and Investment Advice; 52591:Open-End Investment Funds; 52599:Other Financial Vehicles; Activists; Business And Economics--Banking And Finance; Capital expenditures; Chief executive officer; Compensation; Corporate governance; Equity stake; Executive compensation; Hedge fund; Hedge fund activism; Hedge funds; Intervention; Investment; Investments; Mutual fund fire sales; Mutual funds; Personnel policies; Rates of return; Scandals; Securities markets; Shareholder activism; Standard deviation; Stockholders; Variables","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Our theoretical framework highlights the role of competing shareholder demands in providing a salient reference point for a CEO contemplating the implications of tax avoidance for their stock option wealth. In a study of 2,573 publicly listed U.S. firms between 1993 and 2014, we show that the implications of CEO stock option incentives are contingent on whether the firm’s effective tax rate is anticipated to be below or above the tax rate of peer firms – an outcome that the CEO can cast as balancing stakeholder demands. Consistent with our theoretical reasoning, we also show that, both above and below this reference point, the implications of option incentives for corporate tax avoidance are amplified by the level of activist institutional ownership and attenuated by the CEO’s ability to unwind their bond with shareholders through hedging. In doing so, our study offers an impetus for a broader stakeholder approach to governance research examining CEO incentive alignment.","2021-05","2025-02-06 16:37:36","2025-02-06 21:08:32","","782-814","","3","58","","","","","","","","","","English","","","ABI/INFORM Collection; International Bibliography of the Social Sciences (IBSS)","2515975975","","","Place: Oxford Publisher: Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","","","https://libkey.io/libraries/3027/openurl?ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&ctx_enc=info:ofi/enc:UTF-8&rfr_id=info:sid/ProQuest&rft_val_fmt=journal&rft.genre=article&rft.jtitle=The+Journal+of+Management+Studies&rft.atitle=Stakeholder+Agency+Relationships%3A+CEO+Stock+Options+and+Corporate+Tax+Avoidance&rft.au=Zolotoy%2C+Leon%3BDon+O%E2%80%99Sullivan%3BMartin%2C+Geoffrey+P%3BWiseman%2C+Robert+M.&rft.aulast=Zolotoy&rft.aufirst=Leon&rft.date=2021-05-01&rft.volume=58&rft.issue=3&rft.spage=782&rft.isbn=&rft.btitle=&rft.title=The+Journal+of+Management+Studies&rft.issn=00222380&rft_id=info:doi/10.1111%2Fjoms.12623","behavioural agency; Business And Economics--Management; Chief executive officer; Corporate governance; Corporate tax; corporate tax avoidance; Corporate taxes; executive compensation; Governance; Incentives; Ownership; stakeholder agency; Stakeholders; Stock options; Stockholders; Tax avoidance; Tax rates; Taxation; Wealth","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Positioned as an expression of personal morality, such activism is potentially highly influential because of CEOs’ public visibility and associated positional and resource-based power. This paper questions the assumption that CEO activism can only be explained in relation to individual moral action, and illuminates its wider social implications. We critically evaluate the recent upsurge in CEO activism by juxtaposing it against broader social activism, identifying its distinctive characteristics, and empirically examining two recent ‘moral episodes’: the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program and the Fetal Heartbeat Acts (FHAs). Our analysis demonstrates that CEO activism is more heterogeneous than research to date has shown. Building on this analysis, a refined understanding of the character and morality of CEO activism is developed by establishing a typology of its forms. We conclude that while CEO activism is an important and potent new phenomenon, it may not be universally appropriate to regard CEOs as moral leaders. Instead, it is paramount to question the motives and effects of what CEOs do in the name of morality.","2021-05","2025-02-06 16:37:36","2025-02-06 21:08:35","","269-285","","2","170","","","","","","","","","","English","","","ABI/INFORM Collection; International Bibliography of the Social Sciences (IBSS); PAIS Index; ProQuest One Psychology","2512158272","","","Place: Dordrecht Publisher: Springer Nature B.V.","","; ","https://media.proquest.com/media/hms/PFT/1/TYylI?_a=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%2BgIBToIDA1dlYooDHENJRDoyMDI1MDIwNjE2MDgzMzEzOToxMTg1MDM%3D&_s=hyS7u%2FRTuiFSm4usl7c3%2BbeGRYI%3D; https://libkey.io/libraries/3027/openurl?ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&ctx_enc=info:ofi/enc:UTF-8&rfr_id=info:sid/ProQuest&rft_val_fmt=journal&rft.genre=article&rft.jtitle=Journal+of+Business+Ethics&rft.atitle=The+Morality+of+%26ldquo%3Bnew%26rdquo%3B+CEO+Activism%3A+JBE&rft.au=Branicki+Layla%3BBrammer%2C+Stephen%3BPullen%2C+Alison%3BRhodes%2C+Carl.&rft.aulast=Branicki+Layla&rft.aufirst=&rft.date=2021-05-01&rft.volume=170&rft.issue=2&rft.spage=269&rft.isbn=&rft.btitle=&rft.title=Journal+of+Business+Ethics&rft.issn=01674544&rft_id=info:doi/10.1007%2Fs10551-020-04656-5","Activism; Business ethics; CEO activism; Chief executive officer; Chief executives; Childhood; Deferred action for childhood arrivals; Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals; Executives (Business); Fetal heartbeat acts; Law; Morality; Visibility","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To sustain and fund its proxy war in Kashmir valley, over the lastthree decades, Pakistan has created a complex, multi-layered and networked terror financing system with distinct characteristics not obtained in the other conflict theatres. The novel features of raising money include illegal funds raised from allocating medical, engineering, and other higher education seats in Pakistan and other countries, Haj tours and travels, L°C cross-border trade, and Jamaat-i-Islami funding networks. Separatist and extremist entities, including the officers and politicians with dubious loyalties and the separatist media, also raise money through local State government sources. Terror funding is utilized for various ends like running terrorist organizations, extremist religious entities, separatist media, stone-pelting, funding Hurriyat and mainstream political parties, and funding social media and intellectual narratives. India's counter-terror financing efforts received a fillip with the formation of National Investigation Agency (NIA) in 2009. Over the last five years, NIA has launched a massive crackdown on terror funding which has given a significant blow to Pakistan's three-decade-old investment.","2021","2025-02-06 16:37:36","2025-02-06 16:37:36","","382-399","","4","4","","","","","","","","","","English","","","PAIS Index; Worldwide Political Science Abstracts","2674422945","","","Place: New Delhi Publisher: Prints Publications Pvt.

Yet, CEOs are increasingly ignoring this dictum and taking public stances on socially contentious issues. We address this relatively unexplored but important phenomenon by developing a theory of CEO sociopolitical activism. Our stakeholder alignment model posits that CEO activism stems foremost from a CEO's personal values but is facilitated (or suppressed) by the CEO's expectation of support from stakeholders, particularly employees and customers. We also highlight the importance of CEO power, celebrity, and narcissism in influencing whether, and how vividly, the CEO's values manifest in activism. Then, following an episode of CEO activism, stakeholders psychologically respond to the leader's action. Those who were ex ante predisposed toward the CEO's public stance will feel pride in their affiliation with the company, and will consequently experience heightened identification with the firm and with the CEO's stance. Stakeholders who were ex ante averse to the CEO's stance will experience diminished identification with the firm, and their oppositional stance will be further cemented. Finally, we juxtapose CEO activism with other society-oriented firm practices (e.g., corporate social responsibility and corporate lobbying) and develop propositions about their independent and joint effects on stakeholder identification.","2021-01","2025-02-06 16:37:36","2025-02-06 21:08:22","","","","1","46","","","","","","","","","","English","","","ABI/INFORM Collection; International Bibliography of the Social Sciences (IBSS); ProQuest One Psychology","2502226736","","","Place: Briarcliff Manor Publisher: Academy of Management","","","https://libkey.io/libraries/3027/openurl?ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&ctx_enc=info:ofi/enc:UTF-8&rfr_id=info:sid/ProQuest&rft_val_fmt=journal&rft.genre=article&rft.jtitle=Academy+of+Management.+The+Academy+of+Management+Review&rft.atitle=CEO+Sociopolitical+Activism%3A+A+Stakeholder+Alignment+Model&rft.au=Hambrick%2C+Donald+C%3BWowak%2C+Adam+J.&rft.aulast=Hambrick&rft.aufirst=Donald&rft.date=2021-01-01&rft.volume=46&rft.issue=1&rft.spage=&rft.isbn=&rft.btitle=&rft.title=Academy+of+Management.+The+Academy+of+Management+Review&rft.issn=03637425&rft_id=info:doi/10.5465%2Famr.2018.0084","Activism; Business And Economics--Management; Celebrities; Celebrity; Chief executive officer; Chief executive officers; Chief executives; Corporate governance; Customers; Lobbying; Narcissism; Social responsibility; Sociopolitical factors; Stakeholders; Values; Wisdom","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The 2020 recipient of the APA International Humanitarian Award was selected by the Board of Directors, as recommended by the Committee on International Relations in Psychology (CIRP). The career of Niels Peter Rygaard, child psychologist and CEO of the Fairstart Foundation, is an extraordinary example of humanitarian service and activism by a psychologist. After 20 years of research, supervision, and development of care systems for deprived, abandoned, and adopted children, Rygaard cofounded the Fairstart Foundation, a global organization that works to create local systems of quality child care for abandoned, refugee, and separated children who are living without parental care. Fairstart provides free international caregiver group training in local languages and has trained more than 500 instructors from partner organizations and governments. Through the work developed by Dr. Rygaard and the Fairstart Foundation, national care competencies have been strengthened, over 40,000 children in 26 countries have been helped, and a better future has been secured for all children.

After we split target companies into the CEO-turnover and non-CEO-turnover sub-samples, we find that only new CEOs in targeted companies get more compensation following hedge fund activism while incumbent CEO pay does not significantly change. The relationship between CEO bonuses and return on assets following hedge fund activism also differs across the subsamples split by CEO turnover. Pay-performance relationship is enhanced by hedge fund activism for new CEOs, but not for incumbent CEOs. In additional analyses, we document that CEO turnover is positively associated with Tobin's Q and shareholder votes on Say on Pay in target companies after hedge fund activism.","2020-12","2025-02-06 16:37:36","2025-02-06 21:08:28","","1","","6","39","","","","","","","","","","English","","","ABI/INFORM Collection; International Bibliography of the Social Sciences (IBSS); PAIS Index","2503462445","","","Place: New York Publisher: Elsevier Sequoia S.A.","","","https://libkey.io/libraries/3027/openurl?ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&ctx_enc=info:ofi/enc:UTF-8&rfr_id=info:sid/ProQuest&rft_val_fmt=journal&rft.genre=article&rft.jtitle=Journal+of+Accounting+and+Public+Policy&rft.atitle=Hedge+fund+activism%2C+CEO+turnover+and+compensation+%E2%98%86&rft.au=Choi%2C+Wonik%3BGong%2C+James+Jianxin.&rft.aulast=Choi&rft.aufirst=Wonik&rft.date=2020-11-01&rft.volume=39&rft.issue=6&rft.spage=1&rft.isbn=&rft.btitle=&rft.title=Journal+of+Accounting+and+Public+Policy&rft.issn=02784254&rft_id=info:doi/10.1016%2Fj.jaccpubpol.2020.106774","52394:Portfolio Management and Investment Advice; Activism; Activists; Bonus systems; Business And Economics--Public Finance, Taxation; Chief executive officer; Chief executive officers; Chief executives; Companies; Compensation; Employee turnover; Executive compensation; Executives (Business); Governance; Hedge fund; Hedge funds; Pay for performance; Shareholder voting","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Activists curtail empire building through the removal of empire building chief executive officers (CEOs), compensation based incentives, and appointment of new board members.

PDK CEO Josh Starr considers how to stem this decline by presenting teaching as just one part of a pathway into changing the world through education. Although many students enter teacher preparation programs because they envision themselves making a career in the classroom, others tend to be activists who are looking for a way to serve their community. Teacher preparation programs might be able to draw more of these activist students into the profession by treating the classroom as one step in a larger education profession.","2020-11","2025-02-06 16:37:36","2025-02-06 16:37:36","","60-61","","3","102","","","","","","","","","","English","","","ProQuest One Literature","2454337577","","","Place: Bloomington Publisher: Phi Delta Kappa","","","https://libkey.io/libraries/3027/openurl?ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&ctx_enc=info:ofi/enc:UTF-8&rfr_id=info:sid/ProQuest&rft_val_fmt=journal&rft.genre=article&rft.jtitle=Phi+Delta+Kappan&rft.atitle=On+Leadership%3A+Let%26rsquo%3Bs+rethink+the+message+we+send+to+potential+educators&rft.au=Starr%2C+Joshua+P.&rft.aulast=Starr&rft.aufirst=Joshua&rft.date=2020-11-01&rft.volume=102&rft.issue=3&rft.spage=60&rft.isbn=&rft.btitle=&rft.title=Phi+Delta+Kappan&rft.issn=00317217&rft_id=info:doi/10.1177%2F0031721720970705","Activism; classroom; College And Alumni; education; Educational leadership; Leadership; preparation; profession; recruitment; Recruitment; Rethinking; shortages; teacher; Teacher; Teacher education; Teaching","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The sample consists of 200 South Asian health care firms over the period 2010 to 2018. After confirming the prevalence of endogeneity, we rely on the results of system generalized method of moments (GMM) rather than any static model. The results show that a higher representation of women on the board can mitigate the firm’s equity volatility. The findings of the study also purport that CEOs with higher pay–performance sensitivity exploit female directors to take the excessive risk, whereas institutional investors support the risk-averse behavior of these directors. However, we find no statistical evidence that CSR activities moderate the relationship between gender diversity and firm’s equity volatility. Our results theoretically support both stakeholder and agency perspectives that South Asian capital markets should enhance the representation of women on board to mitigate agency conflicts and to improve long-term firm’s sustainability.","2020-10","2025-02-06 16:37:36","2025-02-06 21:08:31","","","","4","10","","","","","","","","","","English","","","Publicly Available Content Database","2473726809","","","Place: Thousand Oaks Publisher: SAGE PUBLICATIONS, INC.","","; ","https://libkey.io/libraries/3027/openurl?ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&ctx_enc=info:ofi/enc:UTF-8&rfr_id=info:sid/ProQuest&rft_val_fmt=journal&rft.genre=article&rft.jtitle=Sage+Open&rft.atitle=Restrictive+and+Supportive+Mechanisms+for+Female+Directors%26rsquo%3B+Risk-Averse+Behavior%3A+Evidence+From+South+Asian+Health+Care+Industry&rft.au=Farzan%2C+Yahya%3BAbbas+Ghulam%3BAmmar%2C+Ahmed%3BHashmi%2C+Muhammad+Sadiq.&rft.aulast=Farzan&rft.aufirst=Yahya&rft.date=2020-10-01&rft.volume=10&rft.issue=4&rft.spage=&rft.isbn=&rft.btitle=&rft.title=Sage+Open&rft.issn=&rft_id=info:doi/10.1177%2F2158244020962777; https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/2158244020962777","Chief executive officers; Corporate social responsibility; CSR; Director; equity volatility; GARCH; gender diversity; Gender diversity; Generalized method of moments; institutional activism; pay–performance sensitivity; Risk averse; Social responsibility; Social Sciences: Comprehensive Works; Volatility","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Despite a strong culture, the open nature of the community presents challenges for cultural assimilation. Central contributors who make up the community’s core engage in activism to combat traditional forms of bias. However, peripheral contributors may not adopt or adhere to the community’s cultural values and may reflect the very bias the community attempts to combat. These differences create tensions between central and peripheral contributors. Peripheral contributors are likely to contribute traditional types of information bias (e.g., bias against women). In response, central contributors may overcorrect in ways that reverse traditional biases. We compare gender bias on female and male CEO profiles and find evidence of bias that advantages women and disadvantages men. While peripheral contributors may dominate early in the life cycle of core-periphery structured open collaboration communities—due to the volume of contributions—the core dominates in the long term through sustained, systematic activism.

Using a comprehensive hand-collected data set, we analyze the drivers, nature, and consequences of such settlement agreements. Settlements are more likely when the activist has a credible threat to win board seats in a proxy fight and when incumbents' reputation concerns are stronger. Consistent with incomplete contracting, face-saving benefits, and private information considerations, settlements commonly do not contract directly on operational or leadership changes sought by the activist but rather on board composition changes. Settlements are accompanied by positive stock price reactions, and they are subsequently followed by changes of the type sought by activists, including CEO turnover, higher shareholder payouts, and improved operating performance. We find no evidence to support concerns that settlements enable activists to extract rents at the expense of other investors. Our analysis provides a look into the ""black box"" of activist engagements and contributes to understanding how activism brings about changes in target companies.","2020-07","2025-02-06 16:37:36","2025-02-06 21:08:24","","1","","1","137","","","","","","","","","","English","","","ABI/INFORM Collection; International Bibliography of the Social Sciences (IBSS)","2444679253","","","Place: Amsterdam Publisher: Elsevier Sequoia S.A.","","","https://libkey.io/libraries/3027/openurl?ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&ctx_enc=info:ofi/enc:UTF-8&rfr_id=info:sid/ProQuest&rft_val_fmt=journal&rft.genre=article&rft.jtitle=Journal+of+Financial+Economics&rft.atitle=Dancing+with+activists&rft.au=Bebchuk%2C+Lucian+A%3BBrav%2C+Alon%3BJiang%2C+Wei%3BKeusch%2C+Thomas.&rft.aulast=Bebchuk&rft.aufirst=Lucian&rft.date=2020-07-01&rft.volume=137&rft.issue=1&rft.spage=1&rft.isbn=&rft.btitle=&rft.title=Journal+of+Financial+Economics&rft.issn=0304405X&rft_id=info:doi/10.1016%2Fj.jfineco.2020.01.001","Activism; Activist settlements; Activists; Business And Economics; Change agents; Corporate governance; Dance; Dancing; Hedge fund activism; Leadership; Rents; Settlement; Shareholder; Stock prices; Stockholders; Studies","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Recent research suggests that CEOs' characteristics can influence their general decisions to engage with stakeholders, however, this work has yet to consider why CEOs might utilize specific stakeholder strategies. In this article, we demonstrate how CEO regulatory focus influences the nature of a firm's stakeholder strategy. Specifically, we argue that CEO prevention focus is positively associated with engagement in governance‐oriented initiatives and receptivity to governance‐oriented stakeholder activism, while CEO promotion focus is positively associated with engagement in socially‐oriented initiatives and receptivity to socially‐oriented stakeholder activism. We find strong support for our hypotheses in a sample of 374 publicly‐traded firms.Managerial summaryThe strategies a firm uses to engage with stakeholders can influence its performance, yet little is known about what makes firms focus on certain stakeholders over others. To better understand this, we examined CEO regulatory focus in a sample of large public companies. Our findings reveal that the way CEOs view decisions—either based on a sense of duty, obligations, and responsibility or as a means to achieve high ideals—influences their tendency to prioritize shareholder concerns or the concerns of a broader array of stakeholders. This suggests that executives should be aware of their own natural tendencies to inject their motivations into their firm's stakeholder strategy and consider avenues to balance their perspectives for the sake of the firm.","2020-07","2025-02-06 16:37:36","2025-02-06 21:08:31","","1305-1335","","7","41","","","","","","","","","","English","","","ABI/INFORM Collection; International Bibliography of the Social Sciences (IBSS)","2407982737","","","Place: Chicago Publisher: Wiley Periodicals Inc.","","","https://libkey.io/libraries/3027/openurl?ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&ctx_enc=info:ofi/enc:UTF-8&rfr_id=info:sid/ProQuest&rft_val_fmt=journal&rft.genre=article&rft.jtitle=Strategic+Management+Journal&rft.atitle=Serving+differently%3A+CEO+regulatory+focus+and+firm+stakeholder+strategy&rft.au=Gamache%2C+Daniel+L%3BNeville%2C+Fran%C3%A7ois%3BBundy%2C+Jonathan%3BShort%2C+Cole+E.&rft.aulast=Gamache&rft.aufirst=Daniel&rft.date=2020-07-01&rft.volume=41&rft.issue=7&rft.spage=1305&rft.isbn=&rft.btitle=&rft.title=Strategic+Management+Journal&rft.issn=01432095&rft_id=info:doi/10.1002%2Fsmj.3134","Activism; Business And Economics--Management; CEO decision-making; CEO decision‐making; Chief executive officer; Chief executives; Companies; Corporate governance; Corporate social responsibilities (CSR); corporate social responsibility; Corporate social responsibility; Decision making; Decision theory; Economic and social effects; Governance; Public company; Recent researches; Receptivity; Regulatory focus; regulatory focus theory; stakeholder strategy; Stakeholders; Strategy research; Upper echelons theories; upper echelons theory","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Public corporations with such powerful CEOs perform differently from traditional companies in statistically significant and often negative ways. Interestingly, studies show that companies with powerful CEOs in turbulent industries, like the technology sector, experience negative firm performance at higher rates than those in more controlled environments. Additionally, these dominant tech CEOs present a corporate governance challenge, one that has not been properly addressed by lax independence requirements for directors, who are often hand-picked by the dominant CEO and have little incentive to advocate aggressively for shareholder value. Traditional governance safeguards championed by activists and shareholder rights groups are also insufficient because of the dominant CEO's control over the nominating and voting processes. As a result, activists, stock exchanges, regulators, and courts must get involved to minimize the negative aspects of CEO dominance that cannot be properly monitored by the board of directors.","2020-05","2025-02-06 16:37:36","2025-02-06 16:37:36","","1899-1929","","4","105","","","","","","","","","","English","","","ABI/INFORM Collection; Worldwide Political Science Abstracts","2420173469","","","Place: Iowa City Publisher: University of Iowa, College of Law","","; ","https://media.proquest.com/media/hms/PFT/1/LEDwG?_a=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%2BgIBToIDA1dlYooDHENJRDoyMDI1MDIwNjE2MDgzMzEzOToxMTg1MDM%3D&_s=DIak7C22t9n56Xo1UQ1YvyGwEQU%3D; https://libkey.io/libraries/3027/openurl?ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&ctx_enc=info:ofi/enc:UTF-8&rfr_id=info:sid/ProQuest&rft_val_fmt=journal&rft.genre=article&rft.jtitle=Iowa+Law+Review&rft.atitle=Total+Control%3A+Corporate+Governance%2C+Firm+Performance%2C+and+Possible+Solutions+for+Reducing+Downside+Risk+in+Technology+Companies+with+Dominant+CEOs&rft.au=Strand%2C+Matthew+L.&rft.aulast=Strand&rft.aufirst=Matthew&rft.date=2020-05-01&rft.volume=105&rft.issue=4&rft.spage=1899&rft.isbn=&rft.btitle=&rft.title=Iowa+Law+Review&rft.issn=00210552&rft_id=info:doi/","Activism; Activists; Boards of directors; Chief executive officer; Companies; Corporate governance; Delaware; Empowerment; Executives (Business); Governance; Initial public offerings; Law; Ownership; Power; Startups; State laws; Stock exchanges; Stockholders; Trends; United States--US; Voting rights","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, PO misfit has received far less attention in the literature. In this article, we look specifically at PO misfit caused by the differing political values and beliefs of the CEO and employee. We argue that CEO activism influences employee perceptions of ideological misfit (IM), whereby differing political beliefs between employees and their activist CEO can impact workplace outcomes. We consider how peer group reactions, ethical climate, external needs fulfillment, and moral identity serve as boundary conditions for perceptions of PO misfit and related organizational outcomes. We also examine antecedents of CEO activism. Drawing on academic literature from both the micro and macro perspectives of management research, we introduce a conceptual model and discuss implications for the firm and its employees.","2020","2025-02-06 16:37:36","2025-02-06 21:08:33","","119-141","","1","125","","","","","","","","","","English","","","ABI/INFORM Collection; Sociological Abstracts","2377220173","","","Place: Hoboken Publisher: Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","","","https://libkey.io/libraries/3027/openurl?ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&ctx_enc=info:ofi/enc:UTF-8&rfr_id=info:sid/ProQuest&rft_val_fmt=journal&rft.genre=article&rft.jtitle=Business+and+Society+Review&rft.atitle=The+effects+of+CEO+activism+on+employees+person%E2%80%90organization+ideological+misfit%3A+A+conceptual+model+and+research+agenda&rft.au=Lee+Warren+Brown%3BManegold%2C+Jennifer+G%3BMarquardt%2C+Dennis+J.&rft.aulast=Lee+Warren+Brown&rft.aufirst=&rft.date=2020-04-01&rft.volume=125&rft.issue=1&rft.spage=119&rft.isbn=&rft.btitle=&rft.title=Business+and+Society+Review&rft.issn=00453609&rft_id=info:doi/10.1111%2Fbasr.12196","Activism; Business And Economics; CEO activism; Chief executive officer; corporate political activity; Employees; ideological misfit; Models; Moral identity; person-organization misfit; person‐organization misfit; Research","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Specifically, it intends to dissect and critically appraise the work of the Global Commission on the Stability of Cyberspace (GCSC), a multistakeholder consortium composed of 28 regionally-diverse scholars, CEOs and (former) policymakers. Inaugurated at the margins of the 2017 Munich Security Conference, the GCSC has been fairly active with regard to developing proposals for norms and policies to enhance international security and stability and guiding responsible conduct in the virtual realm.Design/methodology/approachWith a view to engaging in a differentiated analysis of the Commission’s activities, this paper asks: How do non-state actors such as the GCSC contribute to processes of cybersecurity norm-making, i.e. what are their roles and responsibilities, and how effective is their engagement? Since the end of the Cold War, non- state actors have become an issue of great interest to scholars of International Relations and International Law. However, in the context of cybersecurity, their normative engagement has not been scrutinised extensively. This paper seeks to address this gap.FindingsBased on a review of secondary literature and case materials, this paper finds that, within a relatively short period of time, the GCSC has managed to exert discernible discursive and political influence over discussions on responsible behaviour in cyberspace and deserves recognition as a shaper of transnational cybersecurity governance. However, while fairly successful across the dimensions of output and outcome, the Commission has struggled to effect far-reaching systemic change (impact).Originality/valueIn light of significant contestation and fleeting governmental appetite for enacting red lines in the virtual realm, this paper seeks to critically appraise the contributions of non-state actors to processes of cybersecurity norm-making. The motivation to do so stems from two sources: empirical observations that non-state protagonists have become more involved in issues concerning responsible conduct in cyberspace, and realisations that, so far, academic research has offered little examination of their ideational engagement. Exploring the case of the GCSC, this paper argues that non-state actors have to be taken seriously as normative change agents in cybersecurity governance-related contexts.","2020","2025-02-06 16:37:36","2025-02-06 16:37:36","","93-107","","2","22","","","","","","","","","","English","","","ABI/INFORM Collection; PAIS Index","2498985574","","","Place: Bingley Publisher: Emerald Group Publishing Limited","","; ","https://media.proquest.com/media/hms/PFT/1/DvTTI?_a=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&_s=yppa56YnXq7tACFLMbxONnzgnxw%3D; https://libkey.io/libraries/3027/openurl?ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&ctx_enc=info:ofi/enc:UTF-8&rfr_id=info:sid/ProQuest&rft_val_fmt=journal&rft.genre=article&rft.jtitle=Digital+Policy%2C+Regulation+and+Governance&rft.atitle=Expert+commissions+and+norms+of+responsible+behaviour+in+cyberspace%3A+a+review+of+the+activities+of+the+GCSC&rft.au=Eggenschwiler%2C+Jacqueline.&rft.aulast=Eggenschwiler&rft.aufirst=Jacqueline&rft.date=2020-03-01&rft.volume=22&rft.issue=2&rft.spage=93&rft.isbn=&rft.btitle=&rft.title=Digital+Policy%2C+Regulation+and+Governance&rft.issn=23985038&rft_id=info:doi/10.1108%2FDPRG-03-2019-0019","Behavior; Case studies; Change agents; Cold War; Communications; Computer security; Consortia; Cybersecurity; Cyberspace; Economic; Empirical analysis; Executives (Business); Governance; Intellectuals; International law; International relations; International security; Internet; Literature reviews; Motivation; Non-state actor; Non-state actors; Norm; Norms; Policy making; Political activism; Political power; Responsible behaviour; Stability; Transnationalism; Tribunals & commissions","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In considering the events that led some of the most well-known CEOs in the United States to step away from the Presidential table, the author reviewed the literature in regard to corporate activism and sought to determine whether speaking out or remaining silent had a financial impact on stock price.

We examine the impact of corporate headquarters location on CEO duality for the period 1998-2013. Using the Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) to define the location of corporate headquarters, we find that metropolitan firms are more likely to have CEO-Chairman duality than rural firms. Utilizing idiosyncratic risk and analyst forecast error or dispersion to proxy for information asymmetry, we find that metropolitan firms are more likely to have CEO-chairman duality than rural firms in the low information asymmetry setting.

The companies chosen belonged to the non-financial sector and were listed in the Shanghai stock exchange from 2010 to 2019. The data was extracted from audited annual reports of companies including the director’s report, chairman’s statements, and notes to financial statements. We applied OLS regression as a baseline methodology to determine the extent and impact of CEO power on CSR disclosures. The results indicated significantly negative relationship between the CEOs’ power and CSR disclosure. Our results showed that separate roles of chairman and CEO can reduce agency problems and increase the CSR disclosures. This study is of importance for regulators, as it enforces the view that regulators and policymakers should continue efforts to improve corporate governance practices and CSR reporting in China, as these changes will not only improve the performance of companies but also befit society at large.","2020","2025-02-06 16:37:36","2025-02-06 16:37:36","","2190","","6","12","","","","","","","","","","English","","","Publicly Available Content Database","2377615887","","","Place: Basel Publisher: MDPI AG","","; ","https://media.proquest.com/media/hms/PFT/1/3e7jQ?_a=ChgyMDI1MDIwNjE2MTUwMDU2NTo5NDExNTcSBjEwMjEyNhoKT05FX1NFQVJDSCIPMTI4LjE3OS4xNTQuMjQzKgcyMDMyMzI3MgoyMzc3NjE1ODg3Og1Eb2N1bWVudEltYWdlQgEwUgZPbmxpbmVaAkZUYgNQRlRqCjIwMjAvMDEvMDFyCjIwMjAvMTIvMzF6AIIBIVAtMTAwOTI0MC0xMjAwNi1GUkVFLW51bGwtNjQ1NDg4MpIBBk9ubGluZcoBdU1vemlsbGEvNS4wIChNYWNpbnRvc2g7IEludGVsIE1hYyBPUyBYIDEwXzE1XzcpIEFwcGxlV2ViS2l0LzUzNy4zNiAoS0hUTUwsIGxpa2UgR2Vja28pIENocm9tZS8xMzEuMC4wLjAgU2FmYXJpLzUzNy4zNtIBElNjaG9sYXJseSBKb3VybmFsc5oCB1ByZVBhaWSqAitPUzpFTVMtTWVkaWFMaW5rc1NlcnZpY2UtZ2V0TWVkaWFVcmxGb3JJdGVtygIPQXJ0aWNsZXxGZWF0dXJl0gIBWfICAPoCAVmCAwNXZWKKAxxDSUQ6MjAyNTAyMDYxNjA4MzMxMzk6MTE4NTAz&_s=I5ahzcQfrN8HaKpWMBRqG%2FEywW8%3D; https://libkey.io/libraries/3027/openurl?ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&ctx_enc=info:ofi/enc:UTF-8&rfr_id=info:sid/ProQuest&rft_val_fmt=journal&rft.genre=article&rft.jtitle=Sustainability&rft.atitle=The+Strength+of+CEOs%26rsquo%3BInfluence+on+CSR+in+Chinese+listed+Companies.+New+Insights+from+an+Agency+Theory+Perspective&rft.au=Cherian%2C+Jacob%3BMuhammad+Safdar+Sial%3BDang%2C+Khoa+Tran%3BHwang%2C+Jinsoo%3BThai+Hong+Thuy+Khanh%3BAhmed%2C+Mansoor.&rft.aulast=Cherian&rft.aufirst=Jacob&rft.date=2020-01-01&rft.volume=12&rft.issue=6&rft.spage=2190&rft.isbn=&rft.btitle=&rft.title=Sustainability&rft.issn=&rft_id=info:doi/10.3390%2Fsu12062190","agency theory; Annual reports; Boards of directors; CEO power; Chairman of the board; Chief executive officer; China; Corporate governance; corporate social responsibility disclosure; Developing countries--LDCs; Disclosure; Emerging markets; Environmental Studies; Listed companies; Literature reviews; Management reports; Regulators; Research; Researchers; Self interest; Shareholder activism; Social responsibility; Stock exchanges; Stockholders; Studies; Theory","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

They have successfully advocated for shareholder empowerment initiatives like proxy access, declassified boards, majority voting, say on pay, private fund registration, and the CEO-to-worker pay ratio. They have also served as lead plaintiffs in forty percent of federal securities fraud and Delaware deal class actions. Today, much-discussed reforms like revised shareholder proposal rules and mandatory arbitration threaten two of the main channels by which these shareholders have exercised power. But labor's capital faces its greatest, even existential, threats from outside corporate law. This Essay addresses one of those threats: the direct and indirect challenges posed to labor's capital by the Supreme Court's holding in Janus v. American Federation of State, County, and Municipal Employees, Council 31. These threats may have spillover effects in the corporate arena. This Essay discusses these developments in light of Randall Thomas's early and prescient work on labor as a shareholder.","2019-11","2025-02-06 16:37:36","2025-02-06 16:37:36","","2087-2106","","6","72","","","","","","","","","","English","","","ABI/INFORM Collection; Worldwide Political Science Abstracts","2331233120","","","Place: Nashville Publisher: Vanderbilt Law Review","","; ","https://media.proquest.com/media/hms/PFT/1/TkVoC?_a=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&_s=vE54rEGuS6OPlD1u8tRqLlH2U%2BU%3D; https://libkey.io/libraries/3027/openurl?ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&ctx_enc=info:ofi/enc:UTF-8&rfr_id=info:sid/ProQuest&rft_val_fmt=journal&rft.genre=article&rft.jtitle=Vanderbilt+Law+Review&rft.atitle=The+Other+Janus+and+the+Future+of+Labor%27s+Capital&rft.au=Webber%2C+David+H.&rft.aulast=Webber&rft.aufirst=David&rft.date=2019-11-01&rft.volume=72&rft.issue=6&rft.spage=2087&rft.isbn=&rft.btitle=&rft.title=Vanderbilt+Law+Review&rft.issn=00422533&rft_id=info:doi/","52394:Portfolio Management and Investment Advice; 52399:All Other Financial Investment Activities; 52511:Pension Funds; 81393:Labor Unions and Similar Labor Organizations; Apartheid; Arbitration; Biophysical environment; Capital; Class action lawsuits; Collective bargaining; Corporate governance; Divestment; Divestments; Empowerment; Fees & charges; Fiduciaries; Fiduciary; First Amendment-US; Global warming; Illinois; Janus, Mark; Labor unions; Labour; Law; Municipal employees; Norway; Pension; Pension fund; Pension funds; Political activism; Registration; Shareholder activism; Social; Social investing; South Africa; State laws; Stockholders; Supreme courts; Threats; United States; United States--US; Voting rules; Workers","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The ICAO initiated a new form of engagement—private meetings with independent directors to discuss governance proposals. Compared with a single investor acting alone, the ICAO has stronger incentives to engage in activism. Its dollar holdings and voting power are six times larger and predict direct access to the board and the firms it engages. Firms engaged by the ICAO are at least 58% more likely than non-engaged firms to adopt the ICAO’s governance proposals that include adoption of majority voting, say-on-pay, and specific compensation policies. Engaged firms also increase CEO incentive pay. An event study around the announcement of the ICAO’s formation shows a positive impact on value that increases in both dollar holdings and voting power.

Research on executive turnover has either focused on CEO dismissal or on group‐level top management team (TMT) departure rates, mostly ignoring individual‐level factors that would predict why non‐CEO executives exit. Here, we extend the shock perspective of the unfolding model of turnover used in organizational behavior research to show how relational and reputational shocks influence turnover at the executive level. Our sample includes over 4,000 executives from S&P 1500 firms over 11 years. We hypothesize and find that relational and reputational shocks increase the likelihood of top executive exit. We also consider the moderating influence of pay disparity on these relationships, which impacts how each type of shock influences executive turnover.Managerial SummaryReplacing top executives can be extremely costly for firms. Consequently, understanding the reasons behind top executive exit are important. We examine the effect of different types of shock on the likelihood a top executive will exit their firm. We find that both relational shocks (e.g., other members of the TMT leaving), as well as reputational shocks (e.g., litigation or shareholder activism against the firm), increase turnover. However, we find that higher status executives experience these shocks differently than lower status executives.","2019-07","2025-02-06 16:37:36","2025-02-06 21:08:28","","1151-1168","","7","40","","","","","","","","","","English","","","ABI/INFORM Collection; International Bibliography of the Social Sciences (IBSS)","2231840410","","","Place: Chicago Publisher: Wiley Periodicals Inc.","","","https://libkey.io/libraries/3027/openurl?ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&ctx_enc=info:ofi/enc:UTF-8&rfr_id=info:sid/ProQuest&rft_val_fmt=journal&rft.genre=article&rft.jtitle=Strategic+Management+Journal&rft.atitle=Go+your+own+way%3A+Exploring+the+causes+of+top+executive+turnover&rft.au=Andrus%2C+Joel+L%3BWithers%2C+Michael+C%3BCourtright%2C+Stephen+H%3BBoivie%2C+Steven.&rft.aulast=Andrus&rft.aufirst=Joel&rft.date=2019-07-01&rft.volume=40&rft.issue=7&rft.spage=1151&rft.isbn=&rft.btitle=&rft.title=Strategic+Management+Journal&rft.issn=01432095&rft_id=info:doi/10.1002%2Fsmj.3020","Behavior; Behavioral research; Business And Economics--Management; Chief executive officers; Companies; Dismissal; Executive; executive compensation; Executive compensation; executive exit; executive labor market; Executive labor markets; Executives; Human resource management; Litigation; micro foundations; Micro-foundation; Organizational behavior; Product liability; Teams; Top management; top management teams; Top management teams; Turnover","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The objective of this symposium is to better understand the role of corporations in promoting such systemic change. We present four case studies—representing diverse industries and change mechanisms—-to investigate corporate leadership in sustainability transitions. The cases examine a wide range of mechanisms used by corporations to progress toward sustainability, such as political coalition building and information strategies through eco-labels, socially responsible investing, and the public statements of CEOs. In this introduction, we discuss the challenges associated with both achieving and studying systemic change, explain the rationale for a case study approach, describe the findings from the case studies, and draw some general conclusions on the mechanisms by which firms may be able to lead, or at least participate in, systemic change in the different phases of sustainability transitions.","2019-06","2025-02-06 16:37:36","2025-02-06 21:08:36","","87-97","","2","32","","","","","","","","","","English","","","ABI/INFORM Collection; International Bibliography of the Social Sciences (IBSS); Sociological Abstracts; Worldwide Political Science Abstracts","2229882984","","","Place: Thousand Oaks Publisher: SAGE PUBLICATIONS, INC.","","","https://libkey.io/libraries/3027/openurl?ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&ctx_enc=info:ofi/enc:UTF-8&rfr_id=info:sid/ProQuest&rft_val_fmt=journal&rft.genre=article&rft.jtitle=Organization+%26+Environment&rft.atitle=Understanding+the+Role+of+the+Corporation+in+Sustainability+Transitions&rft.au=Delmas%2C+Magali+A%3BLyon%2C+Thomas+P%3BMaxwell%2C+John+W.&rft.aulast=Delmas&rft.aufirst=Magali&rft.date=2019-06-01&rft.volume=32&rft.issue=2&rft.spage=87&rft.isbn=&rft.btitle=&rft.title=Organization+%26+Environment&rft.issn=10860266&rft_id=info:doi/10.1177%2F1086026619848255","32532:Pesticide and Other Agricultural Chemical Manufacturing; Business And Economics--Management; Canada; Case studies; CEO activism; Changes; Chief executives; Chlorofluorocarbons; Climate change; Companies; Corporate governance; corporate leadership; corporate social responsibility; Corporate social responsibility; Corporation; Earth; ecolabeling; Economic; environmental economics; Environmental labelling; Executives (Business); Leadership; Marine Stewardship Council; Market segments; market transformation; market transition; Montreal Quebec Canada; nongovernmental organization; nongovernmental organizations; Pesticides; Political activism; Politics; Public buildings; Research; Seafood; Social investing; Social responsibility; socially responsible investing; Society; sustainability; Sustainability; Sustainability transitions; Systemic change","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In the 1990s, President Bill Clinton asked federal agencies to investigate violent media. More recently, National Rifle Association CEO Wayne LaPierre directed blame toward video games in the wake of the 2012 Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting. President Trump similarly linked violent video games to the February 2018 shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida. The President recently oversaw a roundtable discussion with video game executives and conservative activists to discuss games as a factor contributing to violence.Political efforts to address video game violence can point to supportive results from past studies. Researchers have looked into the impacts of violent games on aggression and have found some evidence in favor of correlation. Significantly, these studies have focused primarily on immediate short-term influences of violent video games—effects that may last less than five minutes.","2019-04-25","2025-02-06 16:37:36","2025-02-06 16:37:36","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","","PAIS Index; Worldwide Political Science Abstracts","2220771431","","","Place: Chicago Publisher: The University of Chicago","","","https://libkey.io/libraries/3027/openurl?ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&ctx_enc=info:ofi/enc:UTF-8&rfr_id=info:sid/ProQuest&rft_val_fmt=journal&rft.genre=article&rft.jtitle=Chicago+Policy+Review+%28Online%29&rft.atitle=Aggression+and+Video+Games%3A+Do+Violent+Video+Games+Induce+Aggressive+Attitudes+and+Behaviors%3F&rft.au=Iszy+Hirschtritt+Licht.&rft.aulast=Iszy+Hirschtritt+Licht&rft.aufirst=&rft.date=2019-04-25&rft.volume=&rft.issue=&rft.spage=&rft.isbn=&rft.btitle=&rft.title=Chicago+Policy+Review+%28Online%29&rft.issn=&rft_id=info:doi/","Aggression; Aggressiveness; Attitudes; Charlotte Witt; Clinton, Bill; Computer & video games; Dimitrij Tycho Kugler; Experiments; Florida; Government agencies; Gun violence; Hypotheses; Jürgen Gallinat; Katharina Schmalen; LaPierre, Wayne; Markus Weichenberger; Medium; Molecular Psychiatry; MPI for Human Development; Public Administration; Researchers; School violence; Simone Kühn; Studies; Theft; Trump, Donald J; UKEHamburg; United States--US; Video game; Video Games; Video recordings; Violence","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

For the past five years, there has been a high-profile campaign to get environmental nonprofits to disclose their demographic data. This paper examines 12,054 small, medium-sized, and large environmental organizations to find out how many of them have released diversity data on GuideStar. The article also examines how the state in which organizations are located, region of the country, urban or rural setting, organizational typology, amount of revenue, size of the staff, size of the board, gender of the chief executive officer (CEO), race of the CEO, and the year of completion of the GuideStar profile influenced the disclosure of diversity data. The researchers collected financial data from Internal Revenue Service tax forms and diversity data from GuideStar. The study found that 3.7% of the nonprofits studied divulged diversity data. However, organizations in the Pacific and Mid-Atlantic regions were most likely and nonprofits in the South least likely to report diversity data. Urban nonprofits were more likely to divulge diversity data than those located in the suburbs or in the rural areas. The highest level of reporting was in Washington, D.C. In addition, environmental justice organizations were more likely to disclose diversity data than other types of organizations. The larger the staff and the higher the revenue, the more likely it is that the organization divulged its diversity data. Organizations with female CEOs were more likely to reveal diversity data than male-headed nonprofits. Environmental organizations with ethnic/racial minority CEOs were also more likely to disclose demographic data than organizations with white CEOs.","2019","2025-02-06 16:37:36","2025-02-06 16:37:36","","5491","","19","11","","","","","","","","","","English","","","Publicly Available Content Database","2398143994","","","Place: Basel Publisher: MDPI AG","","; ","https://media.proquest.com/media/hms/PFT/1/uJVPG?_a=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&_s=HzrpWJH4HlEYvLwEfz3yHaknynU%3D; https://libkey.io/libraries/3027/openurl?ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&ctx_enc=info:ofi/enc:UTF-8&rfr_id=info:sid/ProQuest&rft_val_fmt=journal&rft.genre=article&rft.jtitle=Sustainability&rft.atitle=Diversity%2C+Equity%2C+and+Inclusion+and+the+Salience+of+Publicly+Disclosing+Demographic+Data+in+American+Environmental+Nonprofits&rft.au=Taylor%2C+Dorceta+E%3BPaul%2C+Sophia%3BMcCoy%2C+Ember.&rft.aulast=Taylor&rft.aufirst=Dorceta&rft.date=2019-01-01&rft.volume=11&rft.issue=19&rft.spage=5491&rft.isbn=&rft.btitle=&rft.title=Sustainability&rft.issn=&rft_id=info:doi/10.3390%2Fsu11195491","19th century; 20th century; Activism; Activists; Demographics; Disclosure; Diversity; Diversity equity & inclusion; Environmental equity; Environmental justice; Environmental organizations; Environmental protection; Environmental Studies; Environmentalists; Equity; ethnicity; gender; Inclusion; Leadership; Minority & ethnic groups; Multiculturalism & pluralism; New York; Nonprofit organization; Nonprofit organizations; Organization; Organizations; race; Racism; Revenue; Rural areas; Social justice; social responsibility; social sustainability; Suburban areas; Suburbs; transparency; Typology; United States--US; Workforce; Working class; Workplace diversity","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The relocation decision and accounting irregularities discovered after the announcement raised interest from activist investors. The firm responded by enacting a “poison pill,” but control was eventually wrestled away and the CEO was replaced. Examining these events gives students insights into corporate control issues facing a major US corporation.Design/methodology/approachThis case study presents a history of the firm from its founding in 1918 through 2017, with an emphasis on key events from 2012 through 2017. These events include acquisition of a competing firm (Dollar Thrifty), relocation of corporate headquarters, accounting irregularities, restatement of financials, activist investor responses, issuance of a “poison pill,” and turnover in the CEO position.FindingsThe case is intentionally written to “tell the story” of events that relate to issues involving control of the company around the decision to relocate its corporate headquarters. The case highlights potential agency problems between management and shareholders and the market’s response to those problems.Originality/valueNo prior case study considers the topic of corporate control from the perspective of Hertz Global Holdings. This case study can be used by instructors in graduate and undergraduate courses to examine corporate control issues from a “real world” perspective.","2018","2025-02-06 16:37:36","2025-02-06 21:08:08","","1200-1209","","10","44","","","","","","","","","","English","","","ABI/INFORM Collection","2111754965","","","Place: Patrington Publisher: Emerald Group Publishing Limited","","; ","https://media.proquest.com/media/hms/PFT/1/v7eOJ?_a=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&_s=ehyiW55FYwF5W28osdV4qckhoq4%3D; https://libkey.io/libraries/3027/openurl?ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&ctx_enc=info:ofi/enc:UTF-8&rfr_id=info:sid/ProQuest&rft_val_fmt=journal&rft.genre=article&rft.jtitle=Managerial+Finance&rft.atitle=A+look+at+corporate+control%3A+the+case+of+Hertz+Global+Holdings&rft.au=Jones%2C+Travis+L%3BAllen%2C+Marcus+T.&rft.aulast=Jones&rft.aufirst=Travis&rft.date=2018-10-01&rft.volume=44&rft.issue=10&rft.spage=1200&rft.isbn=&rft.btitle=&rft.title=Managerial+Finance&rft.issn=03074358&rft_id=info:doi/10.1108%2FMF-11-2017-0454","48811:Airport Operations; 52321:Securities and Commodity Exchanges; 53211:Passenger Car Rental and Leasing; 92111:Executive Offices; Accounting; Acquisition; Activist investors; Airports; Annual reports; Automobile rentals; Business And Economics--Management; Case studies; Chicago Illinois; Corporate control; Corporate governance; Corporate headquarters; Corporate reorganization; Corporation; Customers; Earnings per share; Employees; Financial restatements; Florida; Frissora, Mark P; Headquarter relocation; Hiring; Holding; Icahn, Carl C; Investments; New York; Presidents; Regulatory approval; Relocation; Restatement of financials; Stock exchanges; Stock prices; Tax refunds; Tenure; United States--US","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We find that the number of blocks that a firm's large institutions hold is positively associated with forced chief executive officer (CEO) turnover-performance sensitivity, abnormal returns around forced CEO turnover announcements and 13D filings, and changes in firm value. These results are particularly evident when institutions have multiple blockholdings in the same industry, when they have activism experience, or when they have long-term blockholdings in their portfolio firms.

It brought together bankers, CEOs, and business elites to promote financialized environmental accounting as a solution to ecosystem degradation. Anti‐capitalist activists, however, opposed the further intrusion of economic logic to environmental decision‐making and resisted its progression. While WFNC organizers were able to advance the concept of “natural capital” through traditional (print and web 1.0) media, they struggled to control the social media narrative. Digital activists were able to challenge the official narrative on Twitter and compel organizers to address the associated social and environmental justice concerns. As such, social media produced the conditions for both abstracting nature into value‐bearing commodities and, simultaneously, resisting such abstraction. Drawing on theories of counter-public organization, public spheres of deliberation, and agonistic confrontation, this paper explores the discursive co‐production of nature in a new digitally mediated world.","2018-03","2025-02-06 16:37:36","2025-02-06 16:37:36","","384-406","","2","50","","","","","","","","","","English","","","International Bibliography of the Social Sciences (IBSS); PAIS Index; Worldwide Political Science Abstracts","2296346283","","","Place: Oxford Publisher: Wiley Subscription Services, Inc.","","","https://libkey.io/libraries/3027/openurl?ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&ctx_enc=info:ofi/enc:UTF-8&rfr_id=info:sid/ProQuest&rft_val_fmt=journal&rft.genre=article&rft.jtitle=Antipode&rft.atitle=Hijacking+the+Narrative%3A+The+First+World+Forum+on+Natural+Capital%2C+%23natcap13%2C+and+Radical+Dissent&rft.au=Matulis%2C+Brett+S%3BMoyer%2C+Jessica+R.&rft.aulast=Matulis&rft.aufirst=Brett&rft.date=2018-03-01&rft.volume=50&rft.issue=2&rft.spage=384&rft.isbn=&rft.btitle=&rft.title=Antipode&rft.issn=00664812&rft_id=info:doi/10.1111%2Fanti.12352","activism; Activism; Activists; Anti-capitalism; Capital; Capitalism; Chief executives; Commodities; Conflict; counterpublic; Degradation; deliberative democracy; Deliberative democracy; Dissent; Ecosystems; Elites; Environmental justice; Executives (Business); Geography; Hijacking; Intrusion; Mass media effects; Narratives; natural capital; Production; Radicalism; Social justice; Social media; Social networks; Twitter","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Concerning the independent variable is as follows: The chief executive officer (CEO) is a dummy variable denoting whether or not the chairman of the board holds the position of CEO. The INDD, which represents the independent directors, is measured according to whether the firm appoints independent directors, or by the ratio of independent directors. The FD, which represents the outside directors, is measured according to whether the firm appoints outside directors, or by the ratio of outside directors. In addition, the authors also add the following five control variables to the regression model: the certified public accountant refers to the auditor-related variables including the audit opinion and whether the firm has previously switched accounting firms. The performance (PER) represents the firm performance in terms of the relative return on assets (ROA). The turnover (TURN) is measured by the natural log of the total liabilities. The SIZE is measured by the natural log of the market value of equity, and the leverage ratio (LEV) is the firm’s debt ratio measured by the ratio of total. The TURN is measured by the natural log of the total liabilities. The SIZE is measured by the natural log of the market value of equity and the LEV is the firm’s debt ratio measured by the ratio of total debt to total assets. The sample comprises 89 firms listed on the SBF 120 index over 2006-2012.FindingsResults reveal that the outside directors have a positive and significant effect on the stock return volatility. Moreover, the firm’s size and ROA have a negative effect on the stock return volatility, which is clearly evidenced in all the regressions. On the other hand, the CEO, audit size and debt ratio have statically significant and positive effects on the stock return volatility.Originality/valueThis study indicates the importance of corporate governance and helps investors and financial economists understand the behavior of the stock prices during a financial crisis. Although the existing studies refer to the influence of corporate governance on the stock prices during a crisis, none of these has ever discussed whether better corporate governance can help reduce the stock price volatility in such a situation.","2018","2025-02-06 16:37:36","2025-02-06 16:37:36","","478-495","","2","60","","","","","","","","","","English","","","ABI/INFORM Collection","2046003219","","","Place: Patrington Publisher: Emerald Group Publishing Limited","","; ","https://media.proquest.com/media/hms/PFT/1/YsMV5?_a=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&_s=KSXDJg2fbUbjORoyO2A6DxBlNf4%3D; https://libkey.io/libraries/3027/openurl?ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&ctx_enc=info:ofi/enc:UTF-8&rfr_id=info:sid/ProQuest&rft_val_fmt=journal&rft.genre=article&rft.jtitle=International+Journal+of+Law+and+Management&rft.atitle=The+effects+of+corporate+governance+on+the+stock+return+volatility&rft.au=Aloui+Mouna%3BJarboui+Anis.&rft.aulast=Aloui+Mouna&rft.aufirst=&rft.date=2018-03-01&rft.volume=60&rft.issue=2&rft.spage=478&rft.isbn=&rft.btitle=&rft.title=International+Journal+of+Law+and+Management&rft.issn=1754243X&rft_id=info:doi/10.1108%2FIJLMA-01-2017-0010","Boards of directors; Business And Economics--Management; Chief executive officers; Corporate governance; Directors; Econometrics; Economic crisis; Financial crisis; Institutional investments; International finance; Investors; Leverage ratio; Outside directors; Performance; Rates of return; Research; Securities markets; Shareholder activism; Stock prices; Stockholders; United Kingdom--UK; Volatility","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Activist investors are extraorganizational stakeholders who, when dissatisfied with some aspect of the way the firm is being managed, seek to change the strategy or operations of the firm. Although some have argued that women will be viewed more favorably than men in top leadership positions (so-called ""female leadership"" advantage logic), we build on role congruity theory to hypothesize that female CEOs are significantly more likely than male CEOs to come under threat from activist investors. Results support our predictions, suggesting that female CEOs may face additional challenges not faced by male CEOs. Practical implications and directions for future research are discussed.

[...]often seen as an important determining factor of MoEs, there will be some meaningful participation by the senior management of both companies in the governance of the combined entity.11 The board of directors and management of the combined company will be composed of a roughly equal number of representatives from each of the merging companies, typically with the CEO of the combined company being elected from one company and the chairman from the other company, at least for an initial period after completion of the transaction.12 It has also occurred in some MoEs that an external candidate was appointed to head the combined company. Most infamous was the merger of Daimler-Benz AG and Chrysler Inc in 1998 where the then CEO of the combined entity (and previously CEO of Daimler-Benz), Jürgen Schrempp, claimed in an interview only two years after the deal closed that the term 'merger of equals' was used purely for 'psychological reasons' and that he always intended Chrysler to be a division of Daimler.22 His admission formed the basis for a lawsuit for alleged fraud brought against DaimlerChrysler AG by one of the largest shareholders of Chrysler prior to the merger, Kirk Kerkorian.23 However, the lawsuit was dismissed.24 The constituent parties of the combined entity ultimately separated in 2007.25 It is thus understandable that MoEs have been criticised as a 'symbolic gesture aimed at defusing potential conflicts and smoothing cultural differences'.26 Concealing the true intentions of the parties behind the mask of an MoE can cause a significant loss in credibility should these intentions be exposed. [...]it is essential for companies to articulate clearly and convincingly why it is in the best interests of all stakeholders to structure the deal as an MoE and how 'one plus one will equal more than two'.27 28 The perception of MoEs has also suffered owing to significant value destruction associated with high-profile transactions announced in the second half of the 1990s, in particular Daimler/Chrysler (1998) and AOL/ Time Warner (2000). [...]when seeking to achieve a strategic quantum leap, the larger of the two merger partners in such circumstances is often more inclined to pursue a 'nil or low premium' MoE rather than a takeover bid at a full control premium, to avoid the financial and execution risks associated with a highly leveraged takeover,40 even if this means that it has 'to trade power for premium' through negotiated ownership and governance solutions.41 This also explains the high number of MoEs announced in 2016.","2018-01","2025-02-06 16:37:36","2025-02-06 16:37:36","","59-85","","1","19","","","","","","","","","","English","","","ABI/INFORM Collection; International Bibliography of the Social Sciences (IBSS)","2066610211","","","Place: London Publisher: International Bar Association","","; ","https://media.proquest.com/media/hms/PFT/1/y4E96?_a=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%3D%3D&_s=BOrRTeDaYj4ek9e6UUC3u9TBNag%3D; https://libkey.io/libraries/3027/openurl?ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&ctx_enc=info:ofi/enc:UTF-8&rfr_id=info:sid/ProQuest&rft_val_fmt=journal&rft.genre=article&rft.jtitle=Business+Law+International&rft.atitle=%27Merger+of+Equals%27+Transactions+-+An+Analysis+of+Relevant+Considerations+and+Deal+Trends&rft.au=Georgieff%2C+Alexander%3BLatsky%2C+Stephanie.&rft.aulast=Georgieff&rft.aufirst=Alexander&rft.date=2018-01-01&rft.volume=19&rft.issue=1&rft.spage=59&rft.isbn=&rft.btitle=&rft.title=Business+Law+International&rft.issn=1467632X&rft_id=info:doi/","52321:Securities and Commodity Exchanges; Acquisitions & mergers; Corporate governance; Credibility; Equal; Governance; Law--Corporate Law; Merger; Mergers and acquisitions; Molybdenum disulfide; Ownership; Perceptions; Shareholder activism; Size of enterprise; Stock exchanges; Stockholders; Trends","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
"JKVP3T9J","journalArticle","2018","Strauß, Nadine","The role of trust in investor relations: a conceptual framework","Corporate Communications","","13563289","10.1108/CCIJ-04-2017-0026","https://www.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/role-trust-investor-relations-conceptual/docview/2008380417/se-2?accountid=12006","PurposeThe purpose of this paper is to develop a synthesis for investor relations (IR) research on how to understand, conceptualize and build trust relationships between companies and the financial community within the practice of IR. In doing so, a working definition of the role of trust for IR, a conceptual model as well as strategies on how to establish, maintain and foster trust relationships within IR are proposed. Furthermore, a brief research alley is sketched to inspire more corporate communication scholars to conduct empirical studies in this field of research.Design/methodology/approachThe paper is based on a thorough literature review on empirical and theoretical work in the field of IR, strategic financial communication as well as related disciplines such as public relations, marketing and business research. Furthermore, the literature from other disciplines dealing with trust in the organizational context (economics, psychology, sociology) has been reviewed to develop a working definition for the role of trust in IR.FindingsThe following supposition for the role of trust in IR has been worked out: “Trust relationships within investor relations manifest themselves on a micro-, meso-, and macro-level and involve interactions with various individual actors, groups of people, organizations, institutions, and systems. Within these trust interactions, investor relations presents itself simultaneously three-fold: as a discipline, an organization and as individual practitioners.”Practical implicationsTo support the establishment, maintenance and fostering of trust relationships, IR needs to provide honest, transparent, comprehensive and coherent information to be in continuous, direct and mutual contact with stakeholders (e.g. investors, analysts, CEOs) and to endeavor a fair representation of the company in the media and among the public.Originality/valueFacing recent changes in the media, regulatory and corporate environment, this conceptual paper provides a thorough discussion of the role of trust in the field of IR. The working definition, the conceptual model as well as the practical strategies to build trust relationships provided in this paper might help IR to overcome these challenges. The call for more research in this area and the actual employment of the suggested trust building strategies might contribute to fostering trust relationships in the financial markets, thereby contributing to a more sustainable financial system in the long run.","2018","2025-02-06 16:37:36","2025-02-06 16:37:36","","2-16","","1","23","","","","","","","","","","English","","","ABI/INFORM Collection; ProQuest One Psychology; Sociological Abstracts","2008380417","","","Place: Bradford Publisher: Emerald Group Publishing Limited","","; ","https://media.proquest.com/media/hms/PFT/1/vCPc6?_a=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&_s=P1RUflsXr1ixy8et4s2oNv2gsHQ%3D; https://libkey.io/libraries/3027/openurl?ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&ctx_enc=info:ofi/enc:UTF-8&rfr_id=info:sid/ProQuest&rft_val_fmt=journal&rft.genre=article&rft.jtitle=Corporate+Communications&rft.atitle=The+role+of+trust+in+investor+relations%3A+a+conceptual+framework&rft.au=Strau%C3%9F%2C+Nadine.&rft.aulast=Strau%C3%9F&rft.aufirst=Nadine&rft.date=2018-01-01&rft.volume=23&rft.issue=1&rft.spage=2&rft.isbn=&rft.btitle=&rft.title=Corporate+Communications&rft.issn=13563289&rft_id=info:doi/10.1108%2FCCIJ-04-2017-0026","Business And Economics--Management; Business communications; Calculus; Communication; Companies; Corporate communication; Corporate social responsibility; Economics; Empirical analysis; Employment; Financial crisis; International finance; Investor; Investor relations; Investors; Literature reviews; Marketing; Mass media images; Models; Organizational aspects; Organizational sociology; Psychology; Public relations; Research design; Research methodology; Shareholder activism; Shareholder relations; Social investing; Social networks; Sociology; Stockholders; Strategic management; Strategies; Trust; Work environment","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The guidelines found in Habermas’s “ideal speech situation” (ISS) are essential to guarantee this notion of human dignity. Based on aspects of Habermas’s (ISS), as well as Rainer Forst’s theory of justice, this study analyzes efforts made by the late speaker of Deutsche Bank, Dr. Alfred Herrhausen, and the former CEO of Alcoa and United States Secretary of the Treasury, Paul H. O’Neill, to challenge the way debt crises in the developing world were handled. Both leaders understood indebted countries, the livelihoods and dignity of its citizens, not as an external entity but as an integral part of their agendas. The two agents included underrepresented groups in their considerations and discussions through a proxy or surrogate participation, giving them a greater voice and acknowledging their dignity.","2017-11","2025-02-06 16:37:36","2025-02-06 21:08:18","","125-133","","1","146","","","","","","","","","","English","","","ABI/INFORM Collection; International Bibliography of the Social Sciences (IBSS); PAIS Index; ProQuest One Psychology","1963176064","","","Place: Dordrecht Publisher: Springer Nature B.V.","","; ","https://media.proquest.com/media/hms/PFT/1/fV7M3?_a=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%2BgIBToIDA1dlYooDHENJRDoyMDI1MDIwNjE2MDgzMzEzOToxMTg1MDM%3D&_s=OumGZINmrt%2FGgkzgrou%2FQsxZrX4%3D; https://libkey.io/libraries/3027/openurl?ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&ctx_enc=info:ofi/enc:UTF-8&rfr_id=info:sid/ProQuest&rft_val_fmt=journal&rft.genre=article&rft.jtitle=Journal+of+Business+Ethics&rft.atitle=Aligning+Civic+and+Corporate+Leadership+with+Human+Dignity%3A+Activism+at+the+Intersection+of+Business+and+Government%3A+JBE&rft.au=Kipper%2C+Knut.&rft.aulast=Kipper&rft.aufirst=Knut&rft.date=2017-11-01&rft.volume=146&rft.issue=1&rft.spage=125&rft.isbn=&rft.btitle=&rft.title=Journal+of+Business+Ethics&rft.issn=01674544&rft_id=info:doi/10.1007%2Fs10551-015-2917-5","Activism; Alfred Herrhausen; Business ethics; Crises; Debt; Developing countries--LDCs; Dignity; Discourse ethics; Economic crisis; Ethics; Habermas, Jurgen; Human dignity; Ideal speech situation (ISS); Jürgen Habermas; Justice; Justification; Law; Leadership; Matthias Kettner; Paul H.

We also examine how this association is affected by CEO power and three agency risk factors present in the firm, namely size, leverage, and performance. We find that greater cash in the compensation structure is negatively associated with the likelihood of actual earnings beating forecasted earnings by a large margin. In addition, we find that this negative association is modestly weaker in firms managed by a powerful CEO and stronger in firms that are exposed to more agency risks. Findings generally suggest compensation plans comprised predominantly of cash may promote objective financial reporting oversight performed by the audit committee and more specifically when CEOs are less powerful and need for monitoring is heightened. Our results have implications for investors, directors, regulators, governance activists, and future researchers.","2017-11","2025-02-06 16:37:36","2025-02-06 21:08:20","","304-323","","3","21","","","","","","","","","","English","","","ABI/INFORM Collection; International Bibliography of the Social Sciences (IBSS)","1948357605","","","Place: Oxford Publisher: Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","","","https://libkey.io/libraries/3027/openurl?ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&ctx_enc=info:ofi/enc:UTF-8&rfr_id=info:sid/ProQuest&rft_val_fmt=journal&rft.genre=article&rft.jtitle=International+Journal+of+Auditing&rft.atitle=Audit+committee+cash+compensation+and+propensity+of+firms+to+beat+earnings+by+a+large+margin%3A+Conditional+effects+of+CEO+power+and+agency+risks&rft.au=Rickling%2C+Maria+F%3BSharma%2C+Divesh+S.&rft.aulast=Rickling&rft.aufirst=Maria&rft.date=2017-11-01&rft.volume=21&rft.issue=3&rft.spage=304&rft.isbn=&rft.btitle=&rft.title=International+Journal+of+Auditing&rft.issn=10906738&rft_id=info:doi/10.1111%2Fijau.12098","Agency; analyst forecast; Audit; audit committee; Audit committee; Audit committees; Audits; Boards of directors; Business And Economics--Accounting; cash; CEO power; Chief executive officers; Chief executives; Companies; compensation; Compensation; Compensation plans; corporate governance; Earnings; earnings management; Earnings management; Financial reporting; Governance; Leverage; managerial hegemony; Power; Risk factors","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Additionally, we found that any source of CEO power, whether informal or formal, is a good catalyst for transforming shareholder activism into corporate greening.

We argue that CSO is a legitimacy signal consciously employed by firms to demonstrate their shareholder and specific non-shareholder orientations in the midst of institutional pressures emerging from country and industry contexts. Using a 7-code index of CSO on CEO-shareholder communications from India, we find that in general large firms in India exhibit a pre-dominant, significant and rising trend of pro-shareholder orientation in the six-year period immediately preceding the CSR law. Yet, we uncover significant industry differences in CSO potentially driven by four key factors: the degree of competitive dynamics, nature of products and services, extent of negative externalities and social activism, and exposure to international markets. Our findings support the view that while some minimum threshold of regulatory intervention is required to balance the interests of business with society, legislation raises questions in relation to the usefulness of a uniform one-size-fits-all CSR across all industries.","2017-07","2025-02-06 16:37:36","2025-02-06 21:08:24","","701-719","","4","143","","","","","","","","","","English","","","ABI/INFORM Collection; International Bibliography of the Social Sciences (IBSS); PAIS Index; ProQuest One Psychology","1917626786","","","Place: Dordrecht Publisher: Springer Nature B.V.","","; ","https://media.proquest.com/media/hms/PFT/1/7Hzz1?_a=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%2BgIBToIDA1dlYooDHENJRDoyMDI1MDIwNjE2MDgzMzEzOToxMTg1MDM%3D&_s=58wdF%2BwKcKdry%2Bvyd3X3cNIHjLg%3D; https://libkey.io/libraries/3027/openurl?ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&ctx_enc=info:ofi/enc:UTF-8&rfr_id=info:sid/ProQuest&rft_val_fmt=journal&rft.genre=article&rft.jtitle=Journal+of+Business+Ethics&rft.atitle=Corporate+Stakeholder+Orientation+in+an+Emerging+Country+Context%3A+A+Longitudinal+Cross+Industry+Analysis%3A+JBE&rft.au=Jain%2C+Tanusree%3BAguilera%2C+Ruth+V%3BJamali%2C+Dima.&rft.aulast=Jain&rft.aufirst=Tanusree&rft.date=2017-07-01&rft.volume=143&rft.issue=4&rft.spage=701&rft.isbn=&rft.btitle=&rft.title=Journal+of+Business+Ethics&rft.issn=01674544&rft_id=info:doi/10.1007%2Fs10551-016-3074-1","Activism; Business; Business ethics; Corporate governance; Corporate responsibility; Corporate social responsibility (CSR); Corporate stakeholder orientation (CSO); Corporation; Emerging country; Emerging market; Emerging markets; Externality; India; Industry CSR; Institutional theory; International markets; Intervention; Law; Legislation; Legitimacy; Longitudinal studies; Mandatory CSR; Markets; Organizational behavior; Services; Social responsibility; Stakeholders; Stockholders; Usefulness","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Facing a Senate filibuster, its proponents weakened the proposal—making it, according to historian Jefferson Cowie, ""lean, moderate, and basically unchallenging to the corporate order.""1 Even in its attenuated state, however, the bill would have curbed the most flagrant violations of private-sector workers' rights. Though this version reached the precipice of the supermajority necessary to invoke cloture, it ultimately fell two votes short.This article seeks to understand how antiunion activists defeated organized labor's last big legislative opportunity to reverse its fortunes in the wake of deindustrialization and an onslaught of corporate attacks in the 1970s. Indeed, the right's success in stymieing labor reform was decidedly momentous, especially because the law represented such a modest change. Kim Phillips-Fein has shown that a half a century of activism from market fundamentalist intellectuals and anti–New Deal businessmen paved the way for the formation of the Business Roundtable—a group of powerful CEO's from Fortune 500 companies—and politicized other somnolent forces like the [End Page 378] Chamber of Commerce. In fact, she shows that by the 1970s there was a robust, consciously political ""business activist movement.""2 Kim Moody's account of the failure of the bill—as ""labor's major agenda point of the decade""—centers on the pushback from anti-labor corporate activism, in particular the Roundtable.","2017-07","2025-02-06 16:37:36","2025-02-06 16:37:36","","378-402","","3","29","","","","","","","","","","English","","","PAIS Index; Worldwide Political Science Abstracts","1911518810","","","Place: Cambridge Publisher: Cambridge University Press","","","https://libkey.io/libraries/3027/openurl?ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&ctx_enc=info:ofi/enc:UTF-8&rfr_id=info:sid/ProQuest&rft_val_fmt=journal&rft.genre=article&rft.jtitle=Journal+of+Policy+History+%3A+JPH&rft.atitle=%26quot%3BCompulsory+Unionism%26quot%3B+and+Its+Critics%3A+The+National+Right+to+Work+Committee%2C+Teacher+Unions%2C+and+the+Defeat+of+Labor+Law+Reform+in+1978&rft.au=Shelton%2C+Jon.&rft.aulast=Shelton&rft.aufirst=Jon&rft.date=2017-07-01&rft.volume=29&rft.issue=3&rft.spage=378&rft.isbn=&rft.btitle=&rft.title=Journal+of+Policy+History+%3A+JPH&rft.issn=08980306&rft_id=info:doi/10.1017%2FS0898030617000161","9001:history and theory; 9021:academic discipline; 9141:political economy; 9161:politics and law; Black Power movement; Collective bargaining; Contract negotiations; Deindustrialization; Employees; Employers; Employment policies; Filibusters; Labor law; Labor relations; Labor unions; Labour law; Legal reform; Local elections; political economy; political history/historiography; Political parties; Political representation; Political Science; politics and law; professional issues (teaching, academic careers); Right to work; State elections; Unionization; Wagner Act 1935-US; Workers; Workers' rights","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We argue that top corporate managers' use of language that is congruent with a prevailing norm leads the boards of directors to evaluate the managers more favourably and to grant a higher level of compensation. We test this argument by analysing the letters to shareholders from 334 US firms and examine the CEOs' expression of the shareholder value principle, which is a prevailing model of corporate governance in the USA. We found that the use of shareholder-value language is significantly related to a higher level of CEO compensation and that the effect of shareholder-value language is greater when shareholder activism is stronger.

Several countries have instituted say-on-pay rules (shareholders' right to vote on executive compensation) to reduce excessive compensation. However, determining the effectiveness of say-on-pay is difficult because its tenets vary by country due to political, institutional, cultural, economic, and social factors. Policy issues like say-on-pay are complex, ill-structured problems without definitive assumptions, theories, or solutions. Existing say-on-pay research is inconclusive, since some studies find no change in CEO compensation around its adoption, whereas other studies show that say-on-pay lowers CEO pay or changes its composition. This paper chronicles the history of say-on-pay, compares its implementation by groups (e.g. shareholders-initiated versus legislated and binding versus advisory), discusses the complexities of using say-on-pay to address excessive executive compensation, and recommends future research directions.","2016-12","2025-02-06 16:37:36","2025-02-06 16:37:36","","273","","4","20","","","","","","","","","","English","","","ABI/INFORM Collection","1970168799","","","Place: Camden Publisher: Global Business Publications","","","https://libkey.io/libraries/3027/openurl?ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&ctx_enc=info:ofi/enc:UTF-8&rfr_id=info:sid/ProQuest&rft_val_fmt=journal&rft.genre=article&rft.jtitle=Multinational+Finance+Journal&rft.atitle=Say-on-Pay%3A+Is+Anybody+Listening%3F&rft.au=Mason%2C+Stephani+A%3BMedinets%2C+Ann+F%3BPalmon%2C+Dan.&rft.aulast=Mason&rft.aufirst=Stephani&rft.date=2016-12-01&rft.volume=20&rft.issue=4&rft.spage=273&rft.isbn=&rft.btitle=&rft.title=Multinational+Finance+Journal&rft.issn=10961879&rft_id=info:doi/","Anybody; Business And Economics--Banking And Finance; Corporate governance; Executive compensation; Proposals; Shareholder activism; Stockholders","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The Pattern of Low CEO Pay and High Worker Welfare in Japanese Corporations","American Journal of Comparative Law","","0002-919X","","https://www.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/why-does-executive-greed-prevail-united-states/docview/1844558605/se-2?accountid=12006","According to a list of the 200 most highly paid chief executives at the largest U.S. public companies, in 2012 Oracleâ-(TM)s Lawrence J. Ellison was the best-paid CEO, earning $96.2 million as total annual compensation. He has received $1.8 billion over the 1993â-""2012 time period. The lowest-paid on the same list is General Motorsâ-(TM) D.F. Akerson, who earned $11.1 million. The average national pay for a non-supervisory U.S. worker was $51,200 in 2012, meaning that the average of the top CEOs made 354 times more than the average non-supervisory worker in 2012. Hunter Harrison, Canadian Pacific Railway Ltd., was the best-paid CEO in Canada for 2012 and received CDN $49.2 million in total annual compensation, significantly higher than Canadaâ-(TM)s best-paid CEO in 2011, Magnaâ-(TM)s F. Stronach, who received CDN $40.9 million. In 2011, the average Canadian annual salary was CDN $45,488 and Canadaâ-(TM)s top fifty CEOs earned 235 times more than the average Canadian worker. These executive pay practices contrast with the growing inequality in Canada, recently illustrated with the finding that 40% of Indigenous children live in poverty. In contrast, Japanâ-(TM)s highest-paid CEO is Nissan Motor Co.â-(TM)s Carlos Ghosn, who earned 988 million yen ($10.1 million) in the year ending March 2013, barely changed from the previous year and only modestly improved from his US $9.5 million compensation in 2009. That does not even put him among the top 200 most highly paid U.S. company chiefs and the top twenty best-paid CEOs in Canada for 2012. Why are Japanese CEOs paid considerably less than their American or Canadian counterparts? This Article argues that the activism of long-term-oriented institutional investors such as banks and the tying of executive pay to worker welfare in the context of a culture of intolerance towards excessive executive compensation explain to a great extent the development of a pattern of low executive pay in Japan, despite the recent weakening of bank monitoring as a result of the adoption of a U.S. style of governance in some Japanese companies. The Japanese experience also demonstrates that lower executive compensation does not compromise firm performance and is a necessary condition to building a stakeholder-friendly corporation. For example, the CEO of Toyota (the worldâ-(TM)s biggest automaker), Akio Toyoda, earned 184 million yen ($1.9 million) in 2012, a 35% increase from the previous year.

"X8QETR2K","journalArticle","2016","Ge, Weili; Tanlu, Lloyd; Zhang, Jenny Li","What are the consequences of board destaggering?","Review of Accounting Studies","","13806653","10.1007/s11142-016-9362-2","https://www.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/what-are-consequences-board-destaggering/docview/1810693134/se-2?accountid=12006","In this paper, we examine the consequences of the decision to destagger the election of directors using a sample of firms that switched from a staggered to a destaggered board structure from 2002 through 2010. We find that the likelihood of destaggering increases in shareholder activism, firm size, and poor prior accounting performance. Furthermore, we find that firms that destagger tend to have larger boards and a lower entrenchment index prior to destaggering. We then use our determinants model to identify a sample of control firms that maintained a staggered board structure. Employing a difference-in-differences research design, we find that, relative to our control firms, firms that destaggered experience declines in Tobin's q and accounting performance, measured by ROA. In addition, the negative effect on Tobin's q is most pronounced in firms with greater advisory needs, consistent with the notion that destaggering results in worse performance when the advisory role of boards is more important. Contrary to claims made by proponents of destaggered boards, we find no evidence that CEOs are less entrenched after destaggering. We also provide some evidence suggesting that investment in R&D falls in the post-destaggering period, consistent with the view that after destaggering board members have shortened incentive horizons. Taken together, our evidence is contrary to the earlier studies that claim that destaggered boards are generally optimal and value-increasing.","2016-09","2025-02-06 16:37:37","2025-02-06 16:37:37","","808-858","","3","21","","","","","","","","","","English","","","ABI/INFORM Collection","1810693134","","","Place: New York Publisher: Springer Nature B.V.","","; ","https://media.proquest.com/media/hms/OBJ/98dBS?_a=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&_s=TYUqJag%2B1WEUynRLV8FBjDRZlm4%3D; https://libkey.io/libraries/3027/openurl?ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&ctx_enc=info:ofi/enc:UTF-8&rfr_id=info:sid/ProQuest&rft_val_fmt=journal&rft.genre=article&rft.jtitle=Review+of+Accounting+Studies&rft.atitle=What+are+the+consequences+of+board+destaggering%3F&rft.au=Ge%2C+Weili%3BTanlu%2C+Lloyd%3BZhang%2C+Jenny+Li.&rft.aulast=Ge&rft.aufirst=Weili&rft.date=2016-09-01&rft.volume=21&rft.issue=3&rft.spage=808&rft.isbn=&rft.btitle=&rft.title=Review+of+Accounting+Studies&rft.issn=13806653&rft_id=info:doi/10.1007%2Fs11142-016-9362-2","2110:Boards of directors; 2500:Organizational behavior; 4120:Accounting policies & procedures; 61131:Colleges, Universities, and Professional Schools; 9130:Experimental/theoretical; 9190:United States; Accounting theory; Board; Boards of directors; Business And Economics--Accounting; Classified board; Consequence; Consequences of board destaggering; Corporate culture; Corporate governance; Directors; G30; G34; Law schools; M29; Managers; Pay for performance; Research & development--R&D; Return on assets; Shareholder activism; Shareholder meetings; Shareholders rights; Staggered board; Stockholders; Studies; Tobin's q; United States--US","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Woven into these longings for social acceptance and equality are also issues of ethnicity, citizenship, gender, and sexuality. Despite the labors of civil rights advocates, we stand in the twenty-first century with similar dreams, fears, and struggles: some issues of justice appear to be unsolvable, but for others, the glimmer of the hope for inclusion and social harmony have dawned over the horizon. We have celebrated each visibly tangible evidence of change, as media in the United States has proclaimed each “first” for disenfranchised groups—first mayor, fighter pilot, college dean, CEO, ordained minister, astronaut, openly gay mayor, Supreme Court justice, and U.S. president.

Design/methodology/approach – A quantitative survey was conducted among top executives of listed and private companies operating in the largest European country, Germany (n=602). Findings – The study identifies a traditional mindset: top executives focus on primary stakeholders (customers, employees) instead of secondary stakeholders (politicians, activists), they value mass media higher than social media, and they rate speaking more important than listening. Moreover, communication professionals are not always the first choice when CEOs and board members reflect on the topics at hand. Advanced visions of strategic communication developed in academia and practice have not yet arrived in many boardrooms. Research limitations/implications – The sample is not representative for all CEOs in corporations and it is limited to one country. Originality/value – While the performance of corporate communications depends heavily on the perceptions, beliefs, and expectations that top executives hold towards communication and its contribution to organizational goal, little is known about this. Most knowledge is based on qualitative interviews and small-scale samples. This study provides an overview of previous insights and takes a broader empirical approach.","2015","2025-02-06 16:37:37","2025-02-06 21:08:24","","291-309","","3","20","","","","","","","","","","English","","","ABI/INFORM Collection; ProQuest One Psychology","2083735050","","","Place: Bradford Publisher: Emerald Group Publishing Limited","","; ","https://media.proquest.com/media/hms/PFT/1/HIPc6?_a=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&_s=qFoUsNTeyIcJl3FhmUwDWaJay0o%3D; https://libkey.io/libraries/3027/openurl?ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&ctx_enc=info:ofi/enc:UTF-8&rfr_id=info:sid/ProQuest&rft_val_fmt=journal&rft.genre=article&rft.jtitle=Corporate+Communications&rft.atitle=Corporate+communications+from+the+CEO%26rsquo%3Bs+perspective&rft.au=Zerfass%2C+Ansgar%3BSherzada%2C+Muschda.&rft.aulast=Zerfass&rft.aufirst=Ansgar&rft.date=2015-07-01&rft.volume=20&rft.issue=3&rft.spage=291&rft.isbn=&rft.btitle=&rft.title=Corporate+Communications&rft.issn=13563289&rft_id=info:doi/10.1108%2FCCIJ-04-2014-0020","Business And Economics--Management; Business communications; Chief executive officer; Chief executive officers; Communication; Corporate communication; Corporate communications; Corporation; Digital media; Germany; Institutional theory; Institutionalism; Interviews; Neo-institutionalism; Objectives of corporate communications; Principal-agent-relationships; Professionals; Public opinion; Public relations; Qualitative research; Reputations; Research; Responsibilities; Role of communication professionals; Society; Stakeholders; Strategic communication; Success; Surveys & questionnaires","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

All of these very positive factors point to a stronger more robust position in the world for Cuba both economically and politically. It has long been the position of this journal that Cuba is well placed to become a Caribbean tiger and that once the yoke of the US embargo policy is lifted from its shoulders, it will become an engine for growth and stability within the Caribbean. The signs are that we were not wrong in this assumption.

We theorize that the personal values of the firm's elite decision makers constitute a key element of this corporate opportunity structure. We specifically consider the political ideology -- conservatism versus liberalism -- of the company's CEO as a signal for employees who are considering the merits of engaging in activism. To test of our theory, we examine the formation of lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender employee groups in major companies in the period 1985-2004, when the formation of such groups was generally perceived to be risky for participants. Using CEOs' records of political donations to measure their personal ideologies, we find strong evidence that the political liberalism of CEOs influences the likelihood of activism. We also find that CEOs' ideologies influence activism more strongly when CEOs are more powerful, when they oversee more conservative (i.e., less liberal) workplaces, and when the social movement is in the early phase of development. We identify theoretical and practical implications, as well as future research opportunities.","2014-12","2025-02-06 16:37:37","2025-02-06 21:08:21","","1786-1809","","6","57","","","","","","","","","","English","","","International Bibliography of the Social Sciences (IBSS)","1650533903; 4641345","","","","","","https://libkey.io/libraries/3027/openurl?ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&ctx_enc=info:ofi/enc:UTF-8&rfr_id=info:sid/ProQuest&rft_val_fmt=journal&rft.genre=article&rft.jtitle=Academy+of+Management+journal&rft.atitle=CEO+ideology+as+an+element+of+the+corporate+opportunity+structure+for+social+activists&rft.au=Briscoe%2C+Forrest%3BChin%2C+M+K%3BHambrick%2C+Donald+C.&rft.aulast=Briscoe&rft.aufirst=Forrest&rft.date=2014-12-01&rft.volume=57&rft.issue=6&rft.spage=1786&rft.isbn=&rft.btitle=&rft.title=Academy+of+Management+journal&rft.issn=00014273&rft_id=info:doi/","Activism; Bisexuality; Chief executive officers; Conservatives; Economics; Employees; Lesbianism; Organizational behaviour; Probability; Work place","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Further, the performance difference is larger for firms with higher information costs and better corporate governance.

Building on and extending the insights from political theories of organizations, this paper explores how the historical shift from managerial to investor capitalism has reshaped firm-level power dynamics over executive succession, contributing to the rise of outsider succession. Three developments were particularly crucial-the growth of institutional ownership, the strengthening of internal monitoring by the board, and the rise of shareholder activism. Using data on the complete histories of CEO succession at 686 large U.S. corporations between 1981 and 2005, this article shows how these new developments have pluralized firm-level power struggles over executive succession and thus have further politicized the process. The importance of firm-level power dynamics in the process suggests that a shift in the dominant institutional logic does not directly translate into a new corporate practice, but that such translation depends on the outcome of firm-level power dynamics.

Yet while there is a common core of rules, considerable differences remain, not only in the details, but sometimes also regarding main issues. These differences depend partly on shareholder structure (dispersed or blockholding), partly on path dependent historical, political and social developments, especially on the question of employee representation on the board. More recently, in particular in the wake of the rise of the international corporate governance code movement there has been a clear tendency towards convergence, at least in terms of the formal provisions of the codes. This article analyzes the corporate boards, their regulation in law and codes, and their actual functioning in nine European countries (Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Poland, Sweden, Switzerland and the United Kingdom) from a functional and comparative perspective. Issues dealt with are inter alia board structure, composition and functioning (one tier v. two tier, independent directors, expertise and diversity, separating the chair and the CEO functions, information streams, committees, voting and employee representation); enforcement by liability rules (in particular in cases of conflicts of interest); incentive structures (remuneration); and share-holder activism. The article finds convergence in these European countries resulting from the pressures of competition, a pro-shareholder trend supported by government and institutional investors and, to a certain degree, the impact of the EU. This convergence is more visible in the governance codes and the ensuing practice than in the statutory law. Still, considerable differences remain, in particular as a result of the failure to adopt a mandatory 'no frustration' rule for takeovers at the EU level, and diverging systems of labor codetermination. The overall result is an unstable balance between convergence and divergence, shareholder and stakeholder influence, as well as European v. national rulemaking.","2013-04","2025-02-06 16:37:37","2025-02-06 16:37:37","","301-376","","2","61","","","","","","","","","","English","","","International Bibliography of the Social Sciences (IBSS)","1418135848; 4456166","","","","","","https://libkey.io/libraries/3027/openurl?ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&ctx_enc=info:ofi/enc:UTF-8&rfr_id=info:sid/ProQuest&rft_val_fmt=journal&rft.genre=article&rft.jtitle=American+journal+of+comparative+law&rft.atitle=Corporate+boards+in+Europe-accountability+and+convergence&rft.au=Davies%2C+Paul+L%3BHopt%2C+Klaus+J.&rft.aulast=Davies&rft.aufirst=Paul&rft.date=2013-04-01&rft.volume=61&rft.issue=2&rft.spage=301&rft.isbn=&rft.btitle=&rft.title=American+journal+of+comparative+law&rft.issn=0002919X&rft_id=info:doi/10.5131%2FAJCL.2012.0020","Activism; Board of directors; Comparative law; Corporate governance; Economics; Europe; European Union; Netherlands; Poland; Social development","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

As social actors we all have biased views, as do boardroom members, thus it is necessary to analyse directors' perceptions about their role in order to understand if they are aligned and acting accordingly. The research goal is then to understand what is, in fact, directors' role and contribution. Through a survey-based method board members from Portuguese listed firms were requested to rate the Chairman, the Board, the Senior Independent Director and the CEO performance, through their own perceptions. The survey draws three key conclusions:  first, there are, generally, many inconsistencies around the board role boundaries between the chairman and the CEO and, particularly, around their strategic involvement. Second, tensions arise from the way this relationship evolves affecting both teams (the executive and non-executive directors) and third, there is an absence of a clear picture of the board's role regarding its strategic involvement. This study, whilst exploring and understanding directors and their interactions inside the boardroom in a non-Anglo-American context, contributes to opening the 'black-box' of board dynamics, thus 'dismantling the fortress' in boards studies.","2013","2025-02-06 16:37:37","2025-02-06 16:37:37","","","","1","5","","","","","","","","","","English","","","ABI/INFORM Collection","1465194651","","","Place: Sudbury Publisher: JGBA/CISRO Institute of Management","","; ","https://media.proquest.com/media/hms/ORIG/1/fsHmB?_a=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%3D%3D&_s=OovsB%2FmfdEIOPttiwPwdejbX2CA%3D; https://libkey.io/libraries/3027/openurl?ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&ctx_enc=info:ofi/enc:UTF-8&rfr_id=info:sid/ProQuest&rft_val_fmt=journal&rft.genre=article&rft.jtitle=Journal+of+Global+Business+Administration&rft.atitle=Behind+the+Boardroom%27s+Door%3A+the+Role+and+Contribution+of+Corporate+Boards.&rft.au=Simoes%2C+Ana+Cristina.&rft.aulast=Simoes&rft.aufirst=Ana&rft.date=2013-01-01&rft.volume=5&rft.issue=1&rft.spage=&rft.isbn=&rft.btitle=&rft.title=Journal+of+Global+Business+Administration&rft.issn=1913374X&rft_id=info:doi/","Board; Board of directors; Boards of directors; Business And Economics; Corporate governance; Corporation; Shareholder activism; Stockholders","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) regularly identifies the Brazilian National AIDS Program as an example of ""good practice"" and points to the significance of its government-civil society collaboration (UNAIDS 2007). But even this distinction understates the multifaceted role of grassroots organizations as a driving force in AIDS policy. Their representatives have participated actively on the nation's policymaking commissions as well as in countless planning meetings with Brazilian government officials and politicians. They do not hesitate, however, to voice criticism publicly or, when the state falls short of their expectations, to advance policy through the courts. An unusual blend of grassroots activism and political pragmatism over a 30-year span led to this effective approach to the AIDS epidemic, an effort that the IAF actively supported. Early, proactive responses AIDS arrived in Brazil in the early 1980s. As in the United States and Western Europe, it initially devastated urban gay communities, compounding the stigma and discrimination that already plagued them (Daniel 1991; Parker and Daniel 1991: 17-18; Galvão 2000: 52-59, 173-174). But in contrast to the denial that greeted the appearance of AIDS elsewhere in Latin America, the civic response in Brazil was early and proactive. (See Galvão 2000, Parker 2003.) Brazilians diagnosed as HIV-positive, their families and their friends were the first who rallied to decry alarming death rates, denounce discrimination, educate the public about prevention and pressure the government for increased treatment. Other organizations quickly sprouted, often led by highly educated, well connected professionals dedicated to working with the marginalized. Despite resistance from traditionalists, clergy in some of the largest dioceses helped HIV-positive Brazilians form support groups often allied with the Pastoral da Saúde, the healthcare arm of the Catholic Church. Also notable were the Grupos de Apoio à Prevenção à AIDS (GAPA) that spread from São Paulo to other state capitals, including Salvador, where, in 1994, the IAF funded GAPA-Bahia's preventive services. Brazilians at the helm of some of these pioneering efforts would eventually provide the leadership for the government's AIDS program. Perhaps the best-known of the advocacy groups is Associação Brasileira Interdisciplinar de AIDS (ABIA). Soon after its founding in 1986 by Herbert ""Betinho"" de Souza, ABIA became the first IAF grantee partner funded for the express purpose of producing and disseminating educational materials on AIDS. Betinho himself was an iconic social critic and activist who had spent the 1970s in exile, stripped of his citizenship by the military regime then in power. Upon his return to Brazil, thanks to new amnesty laws, he embarked on a career of grassroots organizing that extended through the early 1990s. Its legacy includes IAF grantee partner Instituto Brasileiro de Análises Sociais e Econômicas (IBASE), highly regarded for its socio-economic research and policy work and launched in 1981 with just three people and a computer. Betinho also led nationwide movements pressuring for agrarian reform and ethics in politics, and organized the massive Citizens' Campaign against Hunger and Poverty and for Life, also supported by the IAF. (See Grassroots Development for 1995, vol. 19, no. 2.) The Citizens' Campaign would later influence the design of social programs instituted under President Luiz Inácio ""Lula"" da Silva, such as Bolsa Família, which has helped lift 28 million Brazilians out of extreme poverty. Betinho reluctantly took on the challenging cause of AIDS in the 1980s, during the early days of the epidemic, when Brazil's blood banks functioned virtually unregulated. An estimated 80 percent of the hemophiliacs in Rio de Janeiro alone contracted HIV through transfusions. Among them were Betinho and his two brothers. Leveraging his national reputation, Betinho announced his diagnosis and put a human face on AIDS in Brazil, much like basketball superstar Magic Johnson did in the United States in 1991. Images of Betinho in a friendly hug, which flooded the media, convinced Brazilians that they could not contract HIV through such a casual social gesture. Brazilian AIDS activist, BetinhoHe also used his access to the media and civil society partners to spur the government to expand its response. To clean up the blood supply, he helped launch a national campaign, Save the Blood of the Brazilian People, eventually winning support for legislation in 1988 that banned the private sale of blood (Galvão 2008). ""Now, the fact that I am fighting back is a relief,"" Betinho said in an interview. ""If you only concentrate on the personal dimension of the misfortune, you will sink with it."" ABIA was instrumental in the passage of the 1996 law mandating free antiretroviral drugs for AIDS patients throughout the country. Brazilians receiving these drugs jumped from 35,900 in 1997 to more than 200,000 in 2007, while the number of reported deaths declined during the same period (Galvão 2008; World Bank 2005:36). Betinho's outreach included meetings with the CEOs of Xerox, Companhia Vale do Rio Doce, Petrobras and other corporate giants to encourage them to provide treatment to their HIV-positive employees, conduct prevention programs in the workplace and donate to grassroots educational efforts. Hesitant at first, executives soon discovered that exercising social responsibility by investing in measures to address the AIDS epidemic improved branding and in some cases the bottom line. Betinho also worked to convince the World Bank that civil society should be an essential component of its AIDS project in Brazil. In 1997, he met with the Bank's president and invited the country director to his home to discuss ways to improve the impact and reach of the Bank's AIDS financing (Galvão 2008). As it turned out, the expertise developed by ABIA and other civic organizations factored into the government's willingness to collaborate with civil society on policy guidelines. To this day ABIA is known as a leading source of information on AIDS in Brazil. Before agreeing to a second loan of $165 million in 1999, for example, the World Bank asked the head of ABIA, Jane Galvão, to determine the social impact of its first loan earmarked to address AIDS. In 1990, ABIA set aside its garage space and $10,000 toward the founding of Grupo PelaVIDDA, an organization intended to complement ABIA's work with more aggressive positions and a greater focus on treatment. PelaVIDDA was headed by another returned exile, Herbert Daniel, openly gay and the AIDS movement's second most iconic figure. The two Herberts were near opposites in personality-Betinho intellectual and reflective, Daniel passionate and expressive-and so were the organizations they led. ABIA's team of physicians, lawyers, sociologists and journalists provided the research and analysis required by the movement to inform legislation and monitor government programs. PelaVIDDA was combative and theatrical, staging protests in pursuit of cultural transformation and grabbing the headlines. Its very existence stemmed from a dramatic gesture: Its founders had all publicly announced their diagnosis without regard for the consequences-a radical move at the time, given the prevailing stigma and ostracism. PelaVIDDA complemented ABIA's agenda by providing needed support for people living with HIV and AIDS, including psychological counseling. It developed the first AIDS hotline in Brazil, after Daniel discovered this tool during a trip to California. Herbert Daniel's groundbreaking work was recognized in AIDS in the World, the seminal book published in 1992, the year he succumbed to AIDS. Eventually the clusters formed by these and other early grassroots AIDS groups evolved into local, regional and nationwide networks that exchanged information and began to influence public policy. Those located in state capitals-São Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, Porto Alegre, Salvador-became active and highly visible. One, Rede Nacional de Pessoas Vivendo com HIV/AIDS (RNP+), grew to include dozens of care and support organizations throughout Brazil. Several others joined forces in 1989 to organize the first National AIDS Conference that brought together hundreds of HIV-positive Brazilians, their family members and activists to discuss community responses (Galvão 2000).","2013","2025-02-06 16:37:37","2025-02-06 16:37:37","","86-95","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","","International Bibliography of the Social Sciences (IBSS)","1459555530; 4504185","","","","","","https://libkey.io/libraries/3027/openurl?ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&ctx_enc=info:ofi/enc:UTF-8&rfr_id=info:sid/ProQuest&rft_val_fmt=journal&rft.genre=article&rft.jtitle=Grassroots+development&rft.atitle=Brazil%27s+virtuous+alliance%3A+how+the+grassroots+and+the+government+joined+forces+against+AIDS&rft.au=Garrison%2C+John%3BRich%2C+Jessica.&rft.aulast=Garrison&rft.aufirst=John&rft.date=2013-01-01&rft.volume=&rft.issue=&rft.spage=86&rft.isbn=&rft.btitle=&rft.title=Grassroots+development&rft.issn=07336608&rft_id=info:doi/","AIDS; Anthropology; Brazil; California; Development programmes; Diseases; Epidemiology; Government policy; Government programmes; HIV; U.S.A.","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Using resource dependency theory as our conceptual framing, we identify some of the drivers of corporate responses to shareholder activists. This study departs from previous studies by including a fourth possible corporate response, engaging in dialogue. Dialogue, an alternative to shareholder resolutions filed by activists, is a process in which corporations and activist shareholder groups mutually agree to engage in ongoing negotiations to deal with social issues. Based on a unique dataset of resolutions filed by member organizations of the Interfaith Center on Corporate Responsibility from 2002 to 2005 and the outcomes of these resolutions, our analysis finds that corporate managers are more likely to engage in dialogue with shareholder activists when the firm is larger, is more responsive to stakeholders, the CEO is the board chair, and the firm has a relatively lower percentage of institutional investors.

Because the existential forces of hubris-expressed above all in those confident drives to mastery conveyed by military elites, financial elites and CEO's-and of ressentiment-expressed in some sectors of secularism and evangelism-now play roles of importance inside the shape of consumption practices, investment portfolios, worker routines, managerial demands, and the uneven senses of entitlement that constitute neoliberal capitalism, activism inside churches, schools, street life and the media must become increasingly skilled and sensitive.

Others claim that CEOs strategically choose CSR activities to reduce the probability of CEO turnover in a future period through indirect support from activists. Still others assert that firms use CSR activities to signal their product quality. We find that firms use governance mechanisms, along with CSR engagement, to reduce conflicts of interest between managers and non-investing stakeholders. Employing a large and extensive sample of firms within Russell 2000, S&500 and Domini 400 indices during the 1993-2004 period, we find that consistent with the conflict-resolution hypothesis, the CSR choice is positively associated with governance characteristics, including board independence, institutional ownership, and analyst following. In addition, after correcting for endogeneity of CSR engagement, our results show that CSR engagement positively influences operating performance and firm value, supporting the conflict-resolution hypothesis as opposed to the over-investment and strategic-choice arguments. We find only a weak support of the product-signaling hypothesis as a major motive of CSR engagement.

We find that when the House passed the Say-on-Pay Bill, the market reaction was significantly positive for firms with high abnormal chief executive officer (CEO) compensation, with low pay-for-performance sensitivity, and responsive to shareholder pressure. However, activist-sponsored say-on-pay proposals target large firms, not those with excessive CEO pay, poor governance, or poor performance. The market reacts negatively to labor-sponsored proposal announcements and positively when these proposals are defeated.

While activists target firms with high CEO pay (whether excessive or not), voting support is higher only at firms with excess CEO pay. Firms with excess CEO pay targeted by vote-no campaigns experience a significant reduction in CEO pay ($7.3 million).

Much hard activist work has gone into furthering the ideals of corporate governance by so many who believed corporations could responsibly regulate themselves. After writing several books on the issue, submitting dozens of shareholder proposals and spending thousands on litigation, proxy issues and board campaigns, I am considering my work in an effort to see the way forward. Even when corporations fought every proposal to separate the chairman and CEO, or Sears spent millions of dollars to keep me off their board or the SEC issued no-action letters on proposals that were identical to those submitted in prior years, I kept pushing for greater corporate responsibility and self-regulation. Therefore, this moment after financial reform and Citizens United seems a good time to reflect upon the twilight of corporate governance and the failures of self-regulation - and where we go from here. This article examines 30 years of corporate self-regulation and its relationship to the recent economic crisis. If corporate governance is at a crossroads, what is needed to go forward? The business corporation has for some 30 years struggled with the challenge of regulating its own affairs and, thereby, liberating the unshackled genius of the capitalist system. Because the government has failed to define precisely the scope of the trustees' responsibility with respect to portfolio companies and has signally declined to enforce the most blatant of fiduciary conflicts, a disincentive for responsible ownership has resulted. This has discouraged the conscientious and enabled disproportionate power for the ruthless. The struggle has, for the present, been lost as the various elements of corporate governance have failed effectively to make corporate power accountable to owners. In addition, as a result of government creation of investment funds and employee benefit plans, trustees whose authority can be derived from existing federal law now are the legal owners of controlling interests in the preponderance of publicly traded companies.","2011-02","2025-02-06 16:37:37","2025-02-06 16:37:37","","62-76","","1","8","","","","","","","","","","English","","","ABI/INFORM Collection","847585557","","","Place: London Publisher: Palgrave Macmillan","","; ","https://media.proquest.com/media/hms/OBJ/MNB9U?_a=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&_s=Bf7M%2F84ieWE9dEi%2BMeS7XklJWfY%3D; https://libkey.io/libraries/3027/openurl?ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&ctx_enc=info:ofi/enc:UTF-8&rfr_id=info:sid/ProQuest&rft_val_fmt=journal&rft.genre=article&rft.jtitle=International+Journal+of+Disclosure+and+Governance&rft.atitle=Governance+at+a+crossroads%3A+A+personal+perspective&rft.au=Monks%2C+Robert+A+G.&rft.aulast=Monks&rft.aufirst=Robert+A&rft.date=2011-02-01&rft.volume=8&rft.issue=1&rft.spage=62&rft.isbn=&rft.btitle=&rft.title=International+Journal+of+Disclosure+and+Governance&rft.issn=17413591&rft_id=info:doi/10.1057%2Fjdg.2010.23","19th century; 52591:Open-End Investment Funds; 92111:Executive Offices; American history; Business And Economics--Banking And Finance; Corporate governance; Corporate responsibility; Crossroads; Democracy; Electoral reform; Federal regulation; Fiduciary responsibility; Finance; Governance; Hegemony; Index funds; Industrial production; Monopolies; Political appointments; Politics; Presidential elections; Private enterprise; SEC regulations; Self-regulation; Stockholders; Wage & price controls","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We also find that higher institutional blockholder ownership increased the likelihood of the adoption in firms managed by less powerful CEOs, while external non-institutional blockholder ownership decreased the likelihood of the adoption.

Proposal submissions in Europe remain infrequent compared to the USA, especially in Continental Europe. In the UK proposals typically relate to a proxy contest seeking board changes, while in Continental Europe they are more focused on specific governance issues. There is some evidence that proposal sponsors are valuable monitors, because the target firms tend to underperform and have low leverage. Sponsors also consider the ownership structure of the firm, because proposal probability increases in the target's ownership concentration and the equity stake of institutional investors. While proposals enjoy limited voting success across Europe, they are relatively more successful in the UK. The outcomes are strongest for proposals targeting the board but are also affected by the target characteristics including the CEO's pay-performance sensitivity. Proposals are met with a significant negative abnormal return of -1.23 percent, when they are voted upon at general meetings. The low voting support gathered by proposals and the strongly adverse market reaction suggest that shareholders of European companies use proposals as an emergency brake rather than a steering wheel.

Common wisdom indicates that shareholders' interests are better protected when the board of directors is composed mostly of independent directors and the firm's leadership structure is split (CEO is not Chairman of the Board). This study investigates the impact of board composition and leadership structure on the likelihood of a shareholder proposal being filed, interpreting the incidence of shareholder proposal filings as shareholder dissatisfaction with corporate governance. The probability of proposals being submitted increases with the size of the firm, a combined leadership structure, and the filing of noncorporate-governance proposals. The probability also increases as the board contains a higher percentage of independent directors (given that the boards are already independent), but decreases as the CEO's tenure increases.

The context of the study is the Directors' Remuneration Report (DRR) Regulations of 2002. This legislation gave shareholders a mandatory non-binding vote on boardroom pay in the UK.Research Findings/Insights: First, we find that less than 10 per cent of shareholders abstain or vote against the mandated Directors' Remuneration Report (DRR) resolution. This percentage is falling over time. Second, investors are more likely to vote against DRR resolutions compared to non-pay resolutions. Third, shareholders are more likely to vote against general executive pay resolutions, such as stock options, long-term incentive plans, and bonus resolutions compared to non-pay resolutions. Forth, firms with higher CEO pay attract greater voting dissent. Fifth, there is little evidence that CEO pay is lower in firms that previously experienced high levels of shareholder dissent. In addition, there is little evidence that the fraction of CEO equity pay, representing owner-manager alignment, is greater in such firms. Currently, we find limited evidence that, on average, 'say on pay' materially alters the subsequent level and design of CEO compensation.Theoretical/Academic Implications: pay. Theoretically, shareholder voting is endogenously determined.Practitioner/Policy Implications: The study provides insights for practitioners and policy makers interested in shareholder rights, the effects on corporate governance, and say on pay in the UK. Shareholder voting appears to have limited effects on curbing excess CEO pay.

The results for CEO equity incentives are similar. We also find that as the presence of institutional ownership siding with management (banks and insurance companies) increases relative to voice activists, the use of equity incentives at middle managerial levels declines. Results for CEO equity incentives are not the same.Theoretical/Academic Implications: find evidence of differing governance mechanisms used by voice activists (e.g., public pension funds) and exit activists (e.g., large shareholders). Voice activists face a higher cost of monitoring managers as compared to exit activists, and thus they will advocate for the heavier use of equity incentive compensation at the middle managerial level. In agreement with a managerial power perspective, however, we also find the use of equity incentives for middle managers decreases as the proportion of institutional ownership siding with the CEO increases.Practitioner/Policy Implications: Shareholder activism plays a key role in aligning managerial interests below the CEO level; however, different types of shareholders have different economic and political interests in how equity compensation is shaped to achieve this. Exit activists use monitoring and voice activists substitute equity compensation for monitoring. Shareholders siding with management may also reduce the use of equity incentives for middle managers. These differing interests should be considered in crafting policy responses.

In this article, we examine how the globalization of national business systems has influenced the framing of corporate social responsibility (CSR). This is done using text analysis of CEO letters appearing in the annual reports of 15 major corporations in Sweden during a period of transformational change. The results show that the discourse about CSR in the annual reports has changed from a national and communitarian view of social responsibility (cf. a negotiated view of CSR) toward an international and individualistic view of social responsibility (cf. a self-regulating view of CSR). The article contributes theoretically (1) by adding a national-global dimension to previous conceptualizations of CSR and (2) by showing that the rise of CSR discourse and activities in the last 10 years does not have to imply an increased commitment and interest in corporate responsibility per se, only that there are increased societal expectations that corporations should develop the capability to act more independently as moral agents.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]","2010-06","2025-02-06 16:37:37","2025-02-06 16:37:37","","653-669","","4","93","","","","","","","","","","English","","","ABI/INFORM Collection; International Bibliography of the Social Sciences (IBSS); PAIS Index; ProQuest One Psychology","198026181","","","Place: Dordrecht Publisher: Springer Nature B.V.","","; ","https://media.proquest.com/media/hms/OBJ/iCAsT?_a=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%3D%3D&_s=ySdxYqRFA0bMRyO6d9x%2Fk%2Fh8FoE%3D; https://libkey.io/libraries/3027/openurl?ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&ctx_enc=info:ofi/enc:UTF-8&rfr_id=info:sid/ProQuest&rft_val_fmt=journal&rft.genre=article&rft.jtitle=Journal+of+Business+Ethics&rft.atitle=The+Framing+of+Corporate+Social+Responsibility+and+the+Globalization+of+National+Business+Systems%3A+A+Longitudinal+Case+Study%3A+JBE&rft.au=Tengblad%2C+Stefan%3BOhlsson%2C+Claes.&rft.aulast=Tengblad&rft.aufirst=Stefan&rft.date=2010-06-01&rft.volume=93&rft.issue=4&rft.spage=653&rft.isbn=&rft.btitle=&rft.title=Journal+of+Business+Ethics&rft.issn=01674544&rft_id=info:doi/10.1007%2Fs10551-009-0246-2","Annual reports; Business; Business ethics; Capital markets; Capitalism; Case studies; Case study; Content analysis; Corporate responsibility; Corporate social responsibility; Framing; Globalization; Human rights; Law; Longitudinal studies; Political activism; Qualitative research; Social responsibility; Standardization; Text analysis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The case perspective is that of the CEO of Degussa AG, a multispecialty chemical company, headquartered in Düsseldorf, Germany. Degussa is considering whether to submit a bid to supply its anti-graffiti coating, Protectosil  ®  , for a new Memorial to the Murdered Jews in Europe being planned for Berlin. Degussa's ethical dilemma is that a former Degussa subsidiary, Degesch, manufactured and supplied the Zyklon B nerve gas used by the Nazis to kill Jews in the concentration camps during World War II. Although Degussa has made attempts both to acknowledge and to atone for its war-time Nazi collaboration, public disclosure of its bid has the potential to engulf Degussa in controversy when activists and Jewish leaders learn of it. Students are asked to evaluate the bid's benefits and costs to Degussa's stakeholders, to consider the relevance of a company's historical legacy to contemporary decision making, and to explore how German corporate history during and after the Holocaust has parallels to human rights issues in other countries.

It raises the question of 'Why Institutions Matter' to politics, by revisiting civil society organizations role, and 'Why Social Capital also Matters' for making democracy work in South Korea. Promoting civil society activism is a necessary but insufficient condition for making democracy work. To support this notion the study turns to an analysis of the episode on how 'de-legitimization politics' waged by certain civil society groups against the Lee government, during the anti-U.S. beef-import firestorm in the summer months of 2008. The legitimization challenge posed by certain civil society groups may have risked the danger of de-democratization of Korea's Sixth Republic, as intended by key opposition political forces. Yet, the campaign for de-legitimization of a constitutionally elected Lee Myung-bak Government did not succeed.

In contrast to lobbying efforts by individual companies or specific trade associations, policy planning institutions serve as the place where various owners and CEOs of corporate America in general and the polluter industrial complex in particular transcend their narrower interest group approaches to develop a fuller conception of their overall class interests. Enlisting the services of academic advisers, conservative intellectuals, scientists and lawyers, and other ""technical"" experts, these think-tanks bring together the inner circles of the capitalist and managerial classes to serve as a leadership group on behalf of American capital. As a result, there are extensive interlocking member among the Board, trustees, directors, and other key position in large pollution corporation, think-tanks, foundation, research centers, policy planning groups, banks and financial institutions, and federal advisory committees. The influence of these think-tanks is heightened by the fact that the Democratic and Republican parties do not have their own policy research units. In contrast to much of Europe and other advanced industrial nations, where policy research and advocacy function are undertaken by organized political parties, politicians in the United States are almost completely dependent upon the expertise provided by private policy institutions and network. In addition, think-tanks serve as a ""revolving door"" for the power elite and polluter-industrial complex -- providing the personnel for the rush of political appointments that come with each new administration, and also providing a refuge for discarded government officials. Conservative think-tanks also promote free market techniques such as tradable property and pollution rights, pricing mechanisms, tax incentives, and voluntary agreements for dealing with environmental degradation. They argue that there is little incentive to protect environmental resources that are not privately owned by corporate interests, neglecting the manner in which corporations maximize profit by cutting expenses related to environmental protection and restoration. Instead, conservative think-tanks propose the creation of property right over parts of the environment that are currently free.

Probit analysis using an unbalanced panel of the top 460 UK listed companies from 1990 to 1998 was employed. No evidence of effective board monitoring was found. On the other hand, evidence of institutional shareholder activism was found. In particular, when institutional concentration is high, the turnover-performance link is more negative in relation to stock returns but less negative in relation to accounting performance. This is consistent with institutional investors using a richer set of information than that contained in reported accounting earnings. Further research may examine the effect of board monitoring on the turnover-performance relation after considering the endogeneity of board structure and membership.

In the aftermath of Enron and other corporate frauds world-wide, the paper exploits a unique dataset of institutional ownership and provides additional evidence on the controversial role of boards and institutional investors in replacing inefficient CEOs, as well as on the role of accounting information in the effectiveness of governance processes.","2008","2025-02-06 16:37:37","2025-02-06 21:08:19","","862-872","","9","23","","","","","","","","","","English","","","ABI/INFORM Collection","274701169","","","Place: Bradford Publisher: Emerald Group Publishing Limited","","; ","https://media.proquest.com/media/hms/OBJ/xmrZT?_a=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%3D%3D&_s=SPx0bLOF%2FMHD319XzyWW%2B9dpkKA%3D; https://libkey.io/libraries/3027/openurl?ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&ctx_enc=info:ofi/enc:UTF-8&rfr_id=info:sid/ProQuest&rft_val_fmt=journal&rft.genre=article&rft.jtitle=Managerial+Auditing+Journal&rft.atitle=Are+boards+and+institutional+investors+active+monitors%3F+Evidence+from+CEO+dismissal&rft.au=Florou%2C+Annita%3BPope%2C+Peter.&rft.aulast=Florou&rft.aufirst=Annita&rft.date=2008-11-20&rft.volume=23&rft.issue=9&rft.spage=862&rft.isbn=&rft.btitle=&rft.title=Managerial+Auditing+Journal&rft.issn=02686902&rft_id=info:doi/10.1108%2F02686900810908427","2120:Chief executive officers; 9130:Experimental/theoretical; 9175:Western Europe; Accounting; Annual reports; Board of directors; Boards of directors; Business And Economics--Management; Chief executive officer; Chief executive officers; Corporate governance; Directors; Equity; Executives; Firings; Institutional investments; Institutional investor; Investors; Rates of return; Research design; Return on assets; Shareholder activism; Stockholders; Studies; United Kingdom--UK","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Grundfest [1993. Just vote no: a minimalist strategy for dealing with barbarians inside the gates. Stanford Law Review 45, 857-937] argues that a substantial withheld vote motivates directors to take immediate action to avoid further embarrassment. We find a variety of supportive evidence, including operating performance improvements and abnormal disciplinary chief executive officer (CEO) turnover, indicating that such campaigns induce boards to take actions in shareholders' interests. Furthermore, abnormal turnover is robust to controlling for concurrent events and firm- and CEO-specific controls.

In this paper, I argue that the critics are wrong. While corporate governance and CEO pay are not perfect, a great deal of evidence suggests that CEO pay is largely determined by market forces. CEOs have been affected by the same forces that have increased income inequality. They have not done better than several similar groups. (In fact, average CEO pay declined in real terms from 2000 to 2006.) CEOs are strongly paid for performance. And boards do monitor CEOs. CEO tenures are lower than they have been since tenures began to be measured in the 1970s; CEO turnover is more closely tied to stock performance than it has been since turnover began to be studied in the 1970s. Increased transparency for CEO pay (required by the SEC), increased shareholder activism, and the increased prevalence of majority voting in director elections should further reduce any remaining unwise compensation practices. More regulation, such as the proposed ""Say on Pay"" bill to mandate a shareholder vote on executive compensation, is likely to impose costs with little additional benefit.

This paper examines the reform efforts in the area of executive compensation on the part of Congress, the Securities and Exchange Commission, the exchanges, shareholder activists, institutional investors, business and professional groups. The agency and managerialism literature indicates that executive pay was inconsistently related to firm performance and size. Tosi et al. (2000) criticized prior studies' use of archival performance data in the examination of the relationship between pay and performance. They lamented that archival performance data did not tap all dimensions of CEOs' job performance requirements.

Over a series of several months, hundreds of thousands of people took part in demonstrations that created a deep political crisis and forced Thaksin to call snap elections. This political crisis was partly a result of intra-elite conflict between the old power elite and Thaksin's 'CEO-style' rule, which opened up space for a broader politicisation. However, a closer look at Thaksin's own mass support and a comparison of his populism with Venezuela's President Chavez leads us to the analysis that the crisis resulted from deeper contradictions within Thaksin's 'post neo-liberal' capitalist restructuring project. The movement against Thaksin thus drew on and brought together different sections of Thai society rebelling against Free Trade Agreements, privatisation and authoritarian, corporate-dominated politics. The article concludes with some reflections on the movement and the question of royal intervention and the coup d'etat.

Several studies have explored the rise of evangelical political influence, largely addressing the topic as a social movement.3 Such studies present evangelicals as political outsiders seeking to bring about their vision for the United States through grassroots civic engagement or sometimes through militant force.4 Others have documented the role of evangelicals as a powerful voting bloc, especially within the Republican Party, in recent decades.5 Yet very little of what we know about evangelical political life has been based on interview data with actual political leaders who are evangelicals.","2007-09","2025-02-06 16:37:37","2025-02-06 16:37:37","","883-909,1046","","3","59","","","","","","","","","","English","","","ProQuest One Literature","223315434","","","Place: College Park Publisher: Johns Hopkins University Press","","; ","https://media.proquest.com/media/hms/OBJ/0UqOT?_a=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%2BgIBToIDA1dlYooDHENJRDoyMDI1MDIwNjE2MDgzMzEzOToxMTg1MDM%3D&_s=0I9bntXX0tvFhvRW9tixnABOVwQ%3D; https://libkey.io/libraries/3027/openurl?ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&ctx_enc=info:ofi/enc:UTF-8&rfr_id=info:sid/ProQuest&rft_val_fmt=journal&rft.genre=article&rft.jtitle=American+Quarterly&rft.atitle=Ties+That+Bind+and+Divisions+That+Persist%3A+Evangelical+Faith+and+the+Political+Spectrum&rft.au=Lindsay%2C+D+Michael.&rft.aulast=Lindsay&rft.aufirst=D&rft.date=2007-09-01&rft.volume=59&rft.issue=3&rft.spage=883&rft.isbn=&rft.btitle=&rft.title=American+Quarterly&rft.issn=00030678&rft_id=info:doi/","Bush, George W; Evangelicalism; Faith; Literary And Political Reviews; Political activism; Politics; Presidential elections; Presidents; Republican Party; Respondents; Social movement; Sports; Syntactic movement","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Rockefeller, for their letter of 27 Oct 2006 to the CEO of Exxon-Mobil questioning the corporation's right to exercise the right of free speech in its support of scientists who disagree about the effect of carbon dioxide on global warming. Monckton notes that a new UN report will estimate the greenhouse effect of carbon dioxide at little more than 1% of the natural greenhouse effect & the sea-level rise by 2100 at just 17 inches. Nor is there any evidence that global warming causes more or stronger hurricanes. The devastation of New Orleans by Katrina was due more to the irresponsible lack of human preparation than to the hurricane itself. The only thing on which there is consensus is that there is more carbon dioxide in the air today than a century ago, that humankind may be blamed for the increase, & that some warming may result. How much warming over what period of time & with what effect are questions that cannot be answered at present. Monckton contends that the senators should withdraw their letter to Exxon-Mobil or resign. J.

Indeed, CEO pay continues to skyrocket despite the efforts of shareholder activists, regulators, boards of directors, and investors to rein in executive excess. A recent study by Shivaram Rajgopal of the University of Washington, Terry Shevlin, also of the University of Washington, and Valentina Zamora of Boston College provides new insights into the forces underlying executive compensation. They examine the controversial issue about why it is that executive pay seems to be sensitive to broad, marketwide effects. While the study provides some important insights about executive compensation, it also raises some questions in terms of recent corporate governance reforms.","2007-02","2025-02-06 16:37:37","2025-02-06 16:37:37","","75-77","","1","21","","","","","","","","","","English","","","ABI/INFORM Collection; International Bibliography of the Social Sciences (IBSS)","210510954","","","Place: Briarcliff Manor Publisher: Academy of Management","","","https://libkey.io/libraries/3027/openurl?ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&ctx_enc=info:ofi/enc:UTF-8&rfr_id=info:sid/ProQuest&rft_val_fmt=journal&rft.genre=article&rft.jtitle=The+Academy+of+Management+Perspectives&rft.atitle=Explaining+CEO+Compensation%3A+How+Do+Talent%2C+Governance%2C+and+Markets+Fit+In%3F&rft.au=Rehbein%2C+Kathleen.&rft.aulast=Rehbein&rft.aufirst=Kathleen&rft.date=2007-02-01&rft.volume=21&rft.issue=1&rft.spage=75&rft.isbn=&rft.btitle=&rft.title=The+Academy+of+Management+Perspectives&rft.issn=15589080&rft_id=info:doi/","2120:Chief executive officers; 6400:Employee benefits & compensation; 9130:Experimental/theoretical; 9190:United States; Business And Economics--Management; Chief executive officer; Chief executive officers; Corporate governance; Executive compensation; Governance; Sensitivity; Shareholder activism; Studies; Talent; United States--US","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The social gains are based on the welfare to stake holders in the firm, whereas the private gains are based on shareholder wealth only. Active shareholders influence the contracting game with the CEO, and therefore also the size and the distribution of the surplus to be split between the shareholders and the CEO. Although the model is very simple and focussing on the creation and distribution of welfare between the shareholders and the CEO, we nonetheless identify surprising divergence between the private and social profitability of shareholder activism. Shareholder activism that is privately profitable is not necessarily socially profitable. The distributional effects of shareholder activism may dominate the efficiency effects to make shareholder activism a negative social NPV project.

We argue that both events destabilize organizations but that changes in employment blueprints are tied more tightly to the organization's identity and thus are more destabilizing. We analyze three dimensions of organizational performance among a sample of young high-technology companies in California's Silicon Valley: survival versus failure, launching an initial public offering (IPO), and changes in financial valuations among organizations that underwent an IPO. As predicted, changing the employment blueprint increased the hazard of failure and diminished growth in market value. Appointing an outsider as CEO did not affect the hazard of failure appreciably but did depress the rate of growth in market capitalization. The implications of these results for ecological and institutional perspectives on organizations are discussed.

But in terms of corporate responsibility, Nike didn't always follow its own advice. In the 1990s, protesters railed against sweatshop conditions at some of its overseas suppliers and made Nike the global poster child for corporate ethical fecklessness. The intense pressure that activists exerted on the athletic apparel giant forced it to take a long, hard look at corporate responsibility--sooner than it might have otherwise. In this article, Simon Zadek, CEO of the UK-based institute AccountAbility, describes the bumpy route Nike has traveled to get to a better ethical place, one that cultivates and champions responsible business practices. Organizations learn in unique ways, Zadek contends, but they inevitably pass through five stages of corporate responsibility, from defensive (""It's not our fault"") to compliance (""We'll do only what we have to"") to managerial (""It's the business"") to strategic (""It gives us a competitive edge"") and, finally, to civil (""We need to make sure everybody does it""). He details Nike's arduous trek through these stages-from the company's initial defensive stance, when accusations about working conditions arose, all the way to its engagement today in the international debate about business's role in society and in public policy. As he outlines this evolution, Zadek offers valuable insights to executives grappling with the challenge of managing responsible business practices. Beyond just getting their own houses in order, the author argues, companies need to stay abreast of the public's evolving ideas about corporate roles and responsibilities. Organizations that do both will engage in what he calls""civil learning"".","2004-12","2025-02-06 16:37:37","2025-02-06 16:37:37","","125-32, 150","","12","82","","","","","","","","","","English","","","MEDLINE®","67188601; 15605571","","","","","","https://libkey.io/libraries/3027/openurl?ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&ctx_enc=info:ofi/enc:UTF-8&rfr_id=info:sid/ProQuest&rft_val_fmt=journal&rft.genre=article&rft.jtitle=Harvard+business+review&rft.atitle=The+path+to+corporate+responsibility.&rft.au=Zadek%2C+Simon.&rft.aulast=Zadek&rft.aufirst=Simon&rft.date=2004-12-01&rft.volume=82&rft.issue=12&rft.spage=125&rft.isbn=&rft.btitle=&rft.title=Harvard+business+review&rft.issn=00178012&rft_id=info:doi/","Clothing -- supply & distribution; Ethics, Business; Guideline Adherence; Humans; Internationality; Learning; Organizational Culture; Product Line Management -- ethics; Social Responsibility; Sports; Textile Industry -- ethics; Textile Industry -- organization & administration; United Kingdom; United States","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Set in the Indian manufacturing sector, it compares the influence of institutional investors and banks against the influence of CEOs and boards on unrelated diversification. Results show that (a) external constituents collectively have more influence on unrelated diversification than CEOs and boards, (b) institutional investors tend to discourage unrelated diversification, but banks are quite supportive of such moves, and (c) corporate governance constituents other than foreign directors do not have a statistically significant influence on unrelated diversification strategies.

We extend this research with an examination of individual indicators of director dependence by partitioning director relationships into six categories. Relying on agency theory in combination with other organizational theories, we test hypotheses about relationships between the different categories of director dependence and the presence of antitakeover provisions and golden parachutes. We find that reciprocated interlocks are positively associated, and inside directors are negatively associated, with the presence of antitakeover provisions. Implications for theory, method, and practice are discussed.

In Asia it is increasingly being managed strategically at the highest corporate levels. A survey of C-suite executives in Asia, North America and Europe by Hill & Knowlton and Korn/Ferry International finds, however, that Asian executives are more focused on using corporate reputation to drive tangible business benefit than their North American and European peers. Corporate social responsibility and the broader range of stakeholders beyond customers and shareholders does not feature strongly in the corporate reputation agenda of Asian executives. The survey results indicate Asian executives are more concerned with core stakeholders, such as customers and shareholders, and bottom-line performance and corporate governance rather than softer areas of reputation management, such as community relations and internal communications. The time has come for Asian CEOs to take a broader perspective to corporate reputation management.

They are the key driver in the public's increasing demand that corporations act in a socially responsible way. This means not only offering products and services that do not pose new environmental or social risks but also doing business in a way that supports the livelihood of people in the producing nations and sustainability of our planet's ecosystems. NGOs are powerful with consumers because they are significantly more trusted overall than business. CEOs and corporate managers may approve or disapprove of the growing role of activist NGOs, but it is perilous to ignore their growing influence and ability to shape public perceptions of a company. There are seven guiding principles for successfully engaging the NGOs: (1) act and respond as one global brand, making certain that, for example, the environmental practices by a unit in Spain are consistent with the corporate position in the USA; (2) prepare for greater transparency, reporting social and environmental impacts as well as financial information is a starting point for building greater trust and dialogue with the NGOs; (3) do not be forced into a ""yes-or-no"" public confrontation on any issue; (4) enlist and engage multiple partners and perspectives on business practices and strategies; (5) do not rely solely on industrywide action, or hide behind it; (6) distinguish between an NGO's rhetoric and its actual objectives; and (7) know when to stand your ground.

Share prices plummeted, films flopped and the ability of Chairman and CEO Michael D. Eisner was seriously questioned. But it is the drama behind the scenes that is keeping corporate America enthralled at present. Although Disney directors are notorious in their unanimous silence as far as the media is concerned, one insider described the unrest between some board members as ""a civilized war"". And not only is there tension within the corporation, but shareholder relations are also far from picture perfect. In April 2002, Eisner, under pressure from Disney director Stanley Gold, hired a ""governance guru"" Ira Millstein. Although Disney may have a long way to go in its battle to win over investors and analysts alike, it is encouraging to see an organization that previously dismissed the notion of board governance now taking an interest.","2003-04","2025-02-06 16:37:37","2025-02-06 16:37:37","","4-7","","4","19","","","","","","","","","","English","","","ABI/INFORM Collection","218631716","","","Place: Bradford Publisher: Emerald Group Publishing Limited","","; ","https://media.proquest.com/media/hms/OBJ/4U3fT?_a=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%2BgIBToIDA1dlYooDHENJRDoyMDI1MDIwNjE2MDgzMzEzOToxMTg1MDM%3D&_s=HsbRum4u72MdkON74RsEHpFGVAc%3D; https://libkey.io/libraries/3027/openurl?ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&ctx_enc=info:ofi/enc:UTF-8&rfr_id=info:sid/ProQuest&rft_val_fmt=journal&rft.genre=article&rft.jtitle=Strategic+Direction&rft.atitle=Disney%27s+boardroom+drama&rft.au=Anonymous.&rft.aulast=Anonymous&rft.aufirst=&rft.date=2003-04-01&rft.volume=19&rft.issue=4&rft.spage=4&rft.isbn=&rft.btitle=&rft.title=Strategic+Direction&rft.issn=02580543&rft_id=info:doi/10.1108%2F02580540310794453","2110:Boards of directors; 2400:Public relations; 8307:Arts, entertainment & recreation; 9190:United States; Accountability; Board of directors; Boards of directors; Business And Economics; Changes; Conflicts of interest; Corporate governance; Directors; Disclosure; Drama; Entertainment industry; Executives; Investments; Shareholder activism; Shareholder relations; Stockholders; Success; United States--US","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The new flag was endorsed by nearly every Mississippian that anyone ever heard of: the present governor and five other statewide elected officials; the former governor who headed the panel that proposed the new flag; the state conference of the NAACP; the bishops of the Roman Catholic, Episcopal, and Methodist churches, leaders of the Presbyterian Church, and the Reverend Donald Wildmon, a nationally influential leader of the Christian Right; the Jackson Clarion Ledger (Mississippi's major newspaper), all the other daily papers in the state 78 that I was able to track down, the student newspaper at the University of Mississippi, and the Mississippi Business Journal; the Mississippi Tourism Association, the Mississippi Economic Council, and the Chambers of Commerce in most of the state's major towns; the Mississippi Manufacturers Association and other trade and professional associations; the management of the Grand Casino in Gulfport; the city council of Jackson (the capital); the presidents of the eight state universities, the faculty senate at Mississippi State, eighty-seven historians from colleges in the state, thirteen head coaches in football, basketball, and baseball at the four largest universities; Myrlie Evers-Williams, widow of civil-rights martyr Medgar Evers and former national chairman of the NAACP; actors Morgan Freeman and Gerald McRaney; authors Ellen Douglas, Barry Hannah, and John Grisham; Jim Barksdale, former CEO of Netscape; football hero Archie Manning; and Mary Ann Mobley, Miss America 1959.

This was a truly remarkable coalition of historic adversaries: civil-rights activists and country-club Republicans; student newspapers and university presidents; casino managers and fundamentalist ministers; trial lawyers and industrialists; college professors and football coaches.

Lee and Stonewall Jackson would have supported changing the flag, and at a conference on Christian unity one minister asked the rhetorical question “What Would Jesus Do?” about the flag.","2002","2025-02-06 16:37:37","2025-02-06 16:37:37","","76–100","","1","8","","","","","","","","","","English","","","ProQuest One Literature","2418404183","","","Place: Chapel Hill Publisher: The University of North Carolina Press","","","https://libkey.io/libraries/3027/openurl?ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&ctx_enc=info:ofi/enc:UTF-8&rfr_id=info:sid/ProQuest&rft_val_fmt=journal&rft.genre=article&rft.jtitle=Southern+Cultures&rft.atitle=The+Banner+That+Won%27t+Stay+Furled&rft.au=Reed%2C+John+Shelton.&rft.aulast=Reed&rft.aufirst=John&rft.date=2002-04-01&rft.volume=8&rft.issue=1&rft.spage=&rft.isbn=&rft.btitle=&rft.title=Southern+Cultures&rft.issn=10688218&rft_id=info:doi/","Banner; Baseball; Business; Cemeteries; Christianity; College presidents; College students; Colleges & universities; Endorsements; Evers-Williams, Myrlie (1933- ); Evers, Medgar (1925-1963); Expenditures; Flags; Football; Fraternity; Freeman, Morgan; Georgia; Governors; Historic buildings & sites; Humanities: Comprehensive Works; Mascots; Military reserves; Mississippi; Mississippian; National Guard; Newspapers; Police; South Carolina; Spot television; Tourism; United States--US; White supremacy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The abnormal stock return upon announcement of activism is approximately 7 percent, with no reversal during the subsequent year. Target firms experience increases in payout and operating performance and higher CEO turnover after activism. We find large positive abnormal return to hedge fund activists, which is higher than the return to other equity-oriented hedge funds.","2008","2025-02-06 16:37:37","2025-02-06 21:17:13","","45-61","","6","64","","","","","","","","","","English","","","International Bibliography of the Social Sciences (IBSS)","37186216; 3883699","","","","","; ","https://media.proquest.com/media/hms/OBJ/LCkaT?_a=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%2BgIBToIDA1dlYooDHENJRDoyMDI1MDIwNjE2MDgzMzEzOToxMTg1MDM%3D&_s=bIQ6rU9d40Y9aW3C3LvP4YsEMDg%3D; https://libkey.io/libraries/3027/openurl?ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&ctx_enc=info:ofi/enc:UTF-8&rfr_id=info:sid/ProQuest&rft_val_fmt=journal&rft.genre=article&rft.jtitle=Financial+analysts+journal&rft.atitle=The+returns+to+hedge+fund+activism&rft.au=Brav%2C+Alon%3BJiang%2C+Wei%3BPartnoy%2C+Frank%3BThomas%2C+Randall+S.&rft.aulast=Brav&rft.aufirst=Alon&rft.date=2000-11-01&rft.volume=64&rft.issue=6&rft.spage=45&rft.isbn=&rft.btitle=&rft.title=Financial+analysts+journal&rft.issn=0015198X&rft_id=info:doi/","Economics; Enterprises; Equity; Finance; Hedging; Investment; Performance; Portfolio management","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

When we discussed possible companies on which to focus our inquiry, Nike was at the top of the list. ""Most kids think they can't live without Nike,"" one student observed. The others agreed that the company holds great sway over young people. Several wondered if we could even compete with its power: ""The whole point of the play would be to get them to join the boycott,"" one student cautioned, ""but most kids would never stop wearing Nike stuff. It wouldn't be cool at all to be against Nike."" Despite these misgivings, they concluded that Nike needed to be researched because ""kids should know all the horrible things they are doing."" Aware that Nike has been a leader in corporate exploitation of Third World low-wage labor, and that a wealth of information was available about its crimes, I strongly endorsed their choice. The students were amazed to discover that almost nothing was made in the United States. I then shared with them the story of a garment company in the news a few years before. The company moved from Michigan, where seamstresses earned seven to eight dollars an hour, to Haiti, where the workers' hourly wage was thirty cents. One child in the class, who served as devil's advocate with lots of verbal ammunition brought from home, proclaimed that companies have the right to move if they can ""make their stuff cheaper someplace else."" Another student reminded him of the information recorded on our original chart, which contrasted the earnings of Nike's and Disney's chiefs (Phil Knight and Michael Eisner, respectively) with the meager wages of their workers. I also reminded the children that in addition to the earnings of the CEOs, shareholders reaped great profits. I referred them to a statistic we had noted earlier: Michael Jordan's earnings for one year of Nike endorsements ($20 million) is equal to the combined pay of 120,000 Indonesians working in Nike plants. ""Michael Eisner is like a vacuum cleaner,"" said one student. ""He sucks everything out of the workers and gives them just barely enough to survive."" After grappling with this complex and disturbing information during those first four weeks, the students crafted a cohesive, inspiring, and intelligent piece of writing. The script was impressive and hard-hitting. The students began with the familiar, scenes taking place on our school playground at recess and at a local McDonalds, then had the audience travel to Nike and Disney factories, then Michael Jordan's mansion and the corporate offices of the two companies. Throughout, they represented their own political education: they showed other kids learning the meaning of the word ""exploit"" and connecting it to their own purchases; they offered a window through which to view a struggling, hungry family in Haiti; they demonstrated the apathy of Jordan and Eisner (Eisner was, by the way, counting his millions when first encountered). The play ends on a note of hope, as two students discuss the growing union movements in the Third World and then present themselves as active agents of change in the same movement: ""If we can get tons of people to join in this movement,"" one actor says, ""I think we can make a difference."" The play concludes with the other actor's response: ""So what are we waiting for. Let's get started."" It was clear to me that the students truly believed in the message they wanted to communicate.","1999-04-30","2025-02-06 16:37:37","2025-02-06 16:37:37","","11","","55","","","","","","","","","","","English","","","ProQuest One Literature","218811221; SFLNSRTCH1101RXDR819000025","","","Place: Brooklyn Publisher: Center for Critical Education of NY","","","https://libkey.io/libraries/3027/openurl?ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&ctx_enc=info:ofi/enc:UTF-8&rfr_id=info:sid/ProQuest&rft_val_fmt=journal&rft.genre=article&rft.jtitle=Radical+Teacher&rft.atitle=Sweating+the+Small+Stuff%3A+Mickey%2C+Michael+and+the+Global+Sweatshop&rft.au=Sweeney%2C+Maria%3BFeld%2C+Marjorie.&rft.aulast=Sweeney&rft.aufirst=Maria&rft.date=1999-04-30&rft.volume=&rft.issue=55&rft.spage=11&rft.isbn=&rft.btitle=&rft.title=Radical+Teacher&rft.issn=01914847&rft_id=info:doi/","Activism; Annual Reports; Basic Vocabulary; Bulletin Boards; Children; Civil rights; Current Events; Curricula; Drama; Education; Elementary Education; Elementary school students; Elementary schools; Elementary Schools; Entertainment; Focus; Grade 4; Haiti; Human rights; Labor; Learning; Michael; Politics; Public Schools; Quotas; Reading Materials; Social Studies; Strikes; Stuff; Sweatshop; Theater; Topic and comment; Union; Video Technology; Wages; Word meaning; Writing Instruction; Writing Skills","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

They have become all-around activists with a more direct involvement in the determinants of corporate success, from brand management to human relations.  In coming down from the mountain, they have discarded the old reliance on organization and process and become much more directly engaged in people and psychological issues.  This behavioral focus parallels one important gauge of a CEO's legitimacy in the eyes of shareholders and employees:  the ability to do.  One of the triggers of CEO interest in matters psychological is the ubiquity of change-management initiatives.  This trend is confirmed by a recent Price Waterhouse study, in which 400 CEOs in North America and Europe were interviewed.  The eye-opening discovery was that 47% of the sample said that the reshaping corporate culture and employee behavior took up a great deal of their time - equal in priority, they said, to monitoring corporate financial information.","1998-09","2025-02-06 16:37:37","2025-02-06 16:37:37","","10-15","","8","87","","","","","","","","","","English","","","ABI/INFORM Collection","206688560; 01690250","","","Place: New York Publisher: American Management Association","","; ","https://media.proquest.com/media/hms/ORIG/5/5aiDF?_a=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&_s=O%2F2QzolJwHmVWhy0RIR9fFgVUoQ%3D; https://libkey.io/libraries/3027/openurl?ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&ctx_enc=info:ofi/enc:UTF-8&rfr_id=info:sid/ProQuest&rft_val_fmt=journal&rft.genre=article&rft.jtitle=Management+Review&rft.atitle=The+CEO+as+psychologist&rft.au=Dauphinais%2C+G+William%3BPrice%2C+Colin.&rft.aulast=Dauphinais&rft.aufirst=G&rft.date=1998-09-01&rft.volume=87&rft.issue=8&rft.spage=10&rft.isbn=&rft.btitle=&rft.title=Management+Review&rft.issn=00251895&rft_id=info:doi/","2120:Chief executive officers; 62133:Offices of Mental Health Practitioners (except Physicians); 9175:Western Europe; 9190:US; Behavior; Business And Economics--Labor And Industrial Relations; Change management; Chief executive officer; Chief executive officers; Corporate culture; Employee behavior; Employees; Europe; Human relations; Management styles; Organizational culture; Psychological aspects; Psychologist; Psychologists; Psychology; United States--US","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

"PKI3TNTX","journalArticle","1997","Bandy, Joe","Reterritorializing Borders: Transnational Environmental Justice Movements on the U.S./Mexico Border","Race, Gender & Class","","10828354","","https://www.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/reterritorializing-borders-transnational/docview/218838382/se-2?accountid=12006","The border context is unique in that it allows immediate and flexible transition between local and transnational phases of resistance; and it has been a site of activism that represents the ambivalence between cultural hybridity and imperialism. Unlike reactionary movements of religious fundamentalists, economic protectionists, or racial/ethnic nationalists that have essentialized local traditions and posited some external corruption (Castells and Kiselyova 1996; Juergensmeyer 1993; Amin 1997:101-3), border environmental justice movements have refused any absolutist identity politics and have worked towards democratic transnational coalitions. Through new communication technologies, increasingly transnational economics, and more mobile diasporas within North America, even border movements have begun to regard transnational cultural and political ties as common sense. Aided by a growing consensus that borderless ecological systems make nationally-based endeavors futile and disastrous (Browne 1996; Kjos 1996; Luna 1996; Tong 1996; Lopez 1997; Saxod 1996), this globalization is expanding the border's historic binationalism to much of the continent and is creating an emerging consciousness of global citizenship. Many concur with CJM's [Susan Mika], who argues, transnational organizing is ""the only thing that makes sense,"" since it is the best leverage against transnational corporations, and since it replaces an imperial transnational culture with one that respects a radical global inclusiveness (Martín del Campo 1996; Mika 1995; Bravo 1996; Tong 1996; Kjos 1996; Luna 1996; Feigen 1997; Medina 1997). Similarly, [Harry Browne] of the IHRC highlights how transnational coalition-building gives local movements greater legitimacy as transnational citizens and enables a wider association of strategies and political voices (1996). Likewise, Casa de la Mujer/Grupo Factor X stresses its work ""constructing networks of action, empowerment and local solidarity, national and international, between women"" (1996). Thus, with an ostensibly practical agenda to address immediate crises of development, these movements are shaping a radically democratic transnational political solidarity -- a network, or red in Spanish -- extending citizenship to the hemispheric level and resisting the local exploitation of neoliberalism.              With the evidence for a disregard of worker's health and safety mounting against Stepan Chemical, and with relatively no legal recourse and unionization, the Coalition for Justice in the Maquiladoras (hereafter CJM) held one of its 1993 meetings in Maywood, New Jersey to help galvanize a transnational campaign against the corporation. With contributions from U.S. environmental organizations, worker health and safety groups, labor unions, and local Mexican community associations, the Coalition began a binational campaign to have Stepan and other maquilas adhere to environmental standards or relocate to safer and less populous areas. After pointing out the contamination problems to the U.S. EPA and Mexico's SEDESOL, colonia leaders met with Stepan officials to wage their grievances. The CJM and the Interfaith Center for Corporate Responsibility filed a shareholder resolution to add the threat of divestment to Stepan's concerns. In Chicago, the location of Stepan's executive offices, local political officials were urged to censure the company, and to CEO Paul Stepan's office was delivered a sample of toxic waste. The CJM produced a short video for documentation entitled, ""Stepan Chemical: The Poisoning of a Mexican Community,"" and they worked with ""Prime Time Live"" to expose the high rates of anencephaly in [Matamoros] and Brownsville. Rather than face increased regulatory and public scrutiny, Stepan Chemical adopted much of the CJM's proposal -- with the important exception of cleaning up past discharges -- by discontinuing dangerous chemicals, eliminating unlined evaporation ponds, removing its discharge pipe, performing site assessments, and beginning comprehensive worker training in the handling of toxic wastes. Using governmental, media, and direct action strategies; linking environmental, labor, and community organizations; and involving both U.S. and Mexican communities, the CJM not only mitigated environmental injustices, but were able to stop the toxic operations of other polluters as well -- Retzloff Chemical and Metales Federados Asarco (CJM 1994:5-7). Although these are only voluntary corporate policies, this campaign solidified a culture of solidarity against corporate abuses and promoted concerns for economic restructuring in the region -- especially NAFTA -- and its effects on local living conditions.","1997-10-31","2025-02-06 16:37:38","2025-02-06 16:37:38","","80","","1","5","","","","","","","","","","English","","","ProQuest One Literature; Sociological Abstracts","218838382; SFLNSRGCL0800RXDZ203000048","","","Place: New Orleans Publisher: Race, Gender and Class","","","https://libkey.io/libraries/3027/openurl?ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&ctx_enc=info:ofi/enc:UTF-8&rfr_id=info:sid/ProQuest&rft_val_fmt=journal&rft.genre=article&rft.jtitle=Race%2C+Gender+%26+Class&rft.atitle=Reterritorializing+Borders%3A+Transnational+Environmental+Justice+Movements+on+the+U.S.%2FMexico+Border&rft.au=Bandy%2C+Joe.&rft.aulast=Bandy&rft.aufirst=Joe&rft.date=1997-10-31&rft.volume=5&rft.issue=1&rft.spage=80&rft.isbn=&rft.btitle=&rft.title=Race%2C+Gender+%26+Class&rft.issn=10828354&rft_id=info:doi/","Activism; Anencephaly; Border; Borders; Citizens; Citizenship; Coalitions; Communication; Community; Community involvement; Community organizations; Companies; Consensus; Corruption; Cultural identity; Diaspora; Economic; Economics; Empowerment; Environment; Environmental justice; Environmental law; Environmental movements; Environmental organizations; Environmentalists; Ethnic Interests; Ethnicity; Evaporation; Exploitation; Foreign policy; GenderWatch; Global citizenship; Globalization; Hazardous wastes; Health; Health problems; Identity politics; Imperialism; Industry; International law; International relations; International trade; Law; Living conditions; Mexico; Organizations; Pointing; Politics; Pollution; Preventive medicine; Public health; Religious movements; Social cohesion; Social justice; Space; Spanish language; Telecommunications; Trade union; Traditions; Transnationalism; United States; United States--US; Y","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Some shareholder groups prefer a non-executive director serving as board chair.  The central concern of reform activists is that joint service as CEO and board chair erodes the corporate system of checks and balances and compromises independence between directors and firm officers.  Not surprisingly, CEOs rarely share this concern.  More than 80% of large firm CEOs also serve as board chair.  They believe the joint leadership structure provides a unified focus and communicates strong leadership to the external community.  A paper focuses on the extent to which chairs who jointly serve as CEO are more, or less, independent than their separate counterparts.  The analysis leads to the conclusion that, while there may sometimes be compelling reasons for formally separating the CEO and board chair positions, to do so as a matter of policy for the purpose of institutionalizing independence between the board of directors and firm management is likely to be a misdirected effort.","1997-08","2025-02-06 16:37:38","2025-02-06 21:08:21","","11-20","","3","11","","","","","","","","","","English","","","ABI/INFORM Collection; International Bibliography of the Social Sciences (IBSS)","210528063; 01490750","","","Place: Briarcliff Manor Publisher: Academy of Management","","; ","https://media.proquest.com/media/hms/OBJ/SIcLU?_a=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%2BgIBToIDA1dlYooDHENJRDoyMDI1MDIwNjE2MDgzMzEzOToxMTg1MDM%3D&_s=H0N9Di8PDftN6Ydis6tBLgKeuNU%3D; https://libkey.io/libraries/3027/openurl?ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&ctx_enc=info:ofi/enc:UTF-8&rfr_id=info:sid/ProQuest&rft_val_fmt=journal&rft.genre=article&rft.jtitle=The+Academy+of+Management+Executive&rft.atitle=CEO+and+board+chair+roles+held+jointly+or+separately%3A+Much+ado+about+nothing%3F&rft.au=Daily%2C+Catherine+M%3BDalton%2C+Dan+R.&rft.aulast=Daily&rft.aufirst=Catherine&rft.date=1997-08-01&rft.volume=11&rft.issue=3&rft.spage=11&rft.isbn=&rft.btitle=&rft.title=The+Academy+of+Management+Executive&rft.issn=10795545&rft_id=info:doi/10.5465%2Fame.1997.9709231660","2110:Boards of directors; 2120:Chief executive officers; 2500:Organizational behavior; 52394:Portfolio Management and Investment Advice; 52511:Pension Funds; 9130:Experimental/theoretical treatment; 9190:US; Agency theory; Board; Boards of directors; Business And Economics--Management; Chairman of the board; Chairperson; Chief executive officer; Chief executive officers; Independence; Independent; Institutional investments; Institutionalisation; Leadership; Organization theory; Pension funds; Stockholders; Studies; United States--US","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In a sample of 620 stock option awards to CEOs of Fortune 500 companies between 1992 and 1994, it was found that the timing of awards coincides with favorable movements in company stock prices.  Patterns of companies' quarterly earnings announcements are consistent with an interpretation that CEOs receive stock option awards shortly before favorable corporate news.  Several alternative explanations of the results are evaluated and rejected, including insider trading and the manipulation of news announcement dates.","1997-06","2025-02-06 16:37:38","2025-02-06 16:37:38","","449-476","","2","52","","","","","","","","","","English","","","ABI/INFORM Collection; International Bibliography of the Social Sciences (IBSS)","194714059; 01425445; 00619789","","","Place: Cambridge Publisher: Blackwell Publishers Inc.","","","https://libkey.io/libraries/3027/openurl?ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&ctx_enc=info:ofi/enc:UTF-8&rfr_id=info:sid/ProQuest&rft_val_fmt=journal&rft.genre=article&rft.jtitle=The+Journal+of+Finance&rft.atitle=Good+timing%3A+CEO+stock+option+awards+and+company+news+announcements&rft.au=Yermack%2C+David.&rft.aulast=Yermack&rft.aufirst=David&rft.date=1997-06-01&rft.volume=52&rft.issue=2&rft.spage=449&rft.isbn=&rft.btitle=&rft.title=The+Journal+of+Finance&rft.issn=00221082&rft_id=info:doi/","1130:Economic theory; 2120:Chief executive officers; 3400:Investment analysis; 6400:Employee benefits & compensation; 9130:Experimental/theoretical treatment; 9190:US; Abnormal returns; Business And Economics--Banking And Finance; Chief executive officer; Chief executive officers; Directors; Disclosure; Economic models; Executive compensation; Expected values; Hypotheses; Incentive plans; Influence; Insider trading; Prices; Proxy statements; Rates of return; Shareholder activism; Stock options; Stock prices; Stockholders; Studies; United States--US","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It is proposed that CEO-directors may typically support fellow CEOs by impeding increased board control over management, but that CEO-directors may also foster this change it they have experienced in their own corporations.  Drawing on social exchange theory, the study develops and tests the argument that these CEO-directors may experience a reversal in the basis for generalized social exchange with other top managers from one of deference and support to one of independence and control.  Using data from a large sample of major US corporations over a recent 10-year period, the study shows: 1.  how CEO directors defect from the network of mutually supportive corporate leaders, 2.  how defections have diffused across organizations and over time, and 3.  how this has contributed to increased board control, as measured by changes in board structure, diversification strategy, and contingent compensation.","1997-03","2025-02-06 16:37:38","2025-02-06 21:08:25","","161-183","","1","42","","","","","","","","","","English","","","ABI/INFORM Collection; International Bibliography of the Social Sciences (IBSS); ProQuest One Psychology; Sociological Abstracts; Worldwide Political Science Abstracts","203962675; 01423699","","","Place: Thousand Oaks Publisher: SAGE PUBLICATIONS, INC.","","; ","https://media.proquest.com/media/hms/OBJ/2ucGU?_a=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&_s=7JqNFqHDO%2F0EeTjvpWIpuzI1z0A%3D; https://libkey.io/libraries/3027/openurl?ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&ctx_enc=info:ofi/enc:UTF-8&rfr_id=info:sid/ProQuest&rft_val_fmt=journal&rft.genre=article&rft.jtitle=Administrative+Science+Quarterly&rft.atitle=Defections+from+the+inner+circle%3A+Social+exchange%2C+reciprocity%2C+and+the+diffusion+of+board+independence+in+U.S.+corporations&rft.au=Westphal%2C+James+D%3BZajac%2C+Edward+J.&rft.aulast=Westphal&rft.aufirst=James&rft.date=1997-03-01&rft.volume=42&rft.issue=1&rft.spage=161&rft.isbn=&rft.btitle=&rft.title=Administrative+Science+Quarterly&rft.issn=00018392&rft_id=info:doi/","2110:Boards of directors; 2120:Chief executive officers; 2500:Organizational behavior; 9130:Experimental/theoretical treatment; 9190:US; Behavioral sciences; Boards of directors; Chief executive officer; Chief executive officers; Corporate governance; Corporation; Directors; Hypotheses; Independence; Reciprocity; Social exchange theory; Sociology; Statistical analysis; Studies; United States--US","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In examining the relationship between duality and firm performance, a study considers the announcement effects of changes in duality status, accounting measures of operating performance for firms that have changed their duality structure, and long-term measures of performance for firms that have had a consistent history of a duality structure.  The results suggest that: 1.  the market is indifferent to changes in a firm's duality status, 2.  there is little evidence of operating performance changes around changes in duality status, and 3.  there is only weak evidence that duality status affects long-term performance, after controlling for other factors that might affect that performance.","1996-01","2025-02-06 16:37:38","2025-02-06 21:08:21","","41","","1","17","","","","","","","","","","English","","","ABI/INFORM Collection; International Bibliography of the Social Sciences (IBSS)","225021057; 01142906","","","Place: Chicago Publisher: Wiley Periodicals Inc.","","; ","https://media.proquest.com/media/pq/classic/doc/415559611/fmt/ai/rep/NONE?_a=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&_s=SDhLsSOgOvQnVV02cL7hCfLcmu0%3D; https://libkey.io/libraries/3027/openurl?ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&ctx_enc=info:ofi/enc:UTF-8&rfr_id=info:sid/ProQuest&rft_val_fmt=journal&rft.genre=article&rft.jtitle=Strategic+Management+Journal&rft.atitle=CEO+duality+and+firm+performance%3A+What%27s+the+fuss%3F&rft.au=Baliga%2C+B+Ram%3BMoyer%2C+R+Charles%3BRao%2C+Ramesh+S.&rft.aulast=Baliga&rft.aufirst=B&rft.date=1996-01-01&rft.volume=17&rft.issue=1&rft.spage=41&rft.isbn=&rft.btitle=&rft.title=Strategic+Management+Journal&rft.issn=01432095&rft_id=info:doi/","1130:Economic theory; 2110:Boards of directors; 3400:Investment analysis; 9130:Experimental/theoretical treatment; 9190:US; Activism; Boards of directors; Business And Economics--Management; Chief executive officer; Company; Corporate governance; Critics; duality; Economic; Economic models; Environmental changes; Financial performance; governance; Hypotheses; Managers; Market shares; performance; Regression analysis; Shareholder value; Stock prices; Stockholders; Studies; United States--US","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Gone are the days of the aloof, all-powerful board that answered to no one.  This movement derived from the abuses of the 1980s; boardroom behavior during that decade was perceived as unresponsive, uncaring, and mercenary.  Today, boardroom issues go beyond mere corporate performance and cut to the heart of both the structure of the US corporate board and the relationship among the board, shareholders, and management.  There are 3 key structural and procedural questions that are provoking debate: 1.  Should the office of CEO be separated from that of chairman of the board? 2.  Should there be a system of communication between the shareholders and outside directors without management involvement? 3.  Should the board take on the role of conflict resolver between the shareholders and management in big issues? At the heart of the discussion is the definition of outside director; conventional wisdom has it that the more outside directors a company has, the better.","1992-10","2025-02-06 16:37:38","2025-02-06 16:37:38","","10","","10","81","","","","","","","","","","English","","","ABI/INFORM Collection","206701596; 00639890","","","Place: New York Publisher: American Management Association","","; ","https://media.proquest.com/media/hms/ORIG/1/P0lDF?_a=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&_s=GpK2MeB%2BVvHdRfIJFgn26bKSjf0%3D; https://libkey.io/libraries/3027/openurl?ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&ctx_enc=info:ofi/enc:UTF-8&rfr_id=info:sid/ProQuest&rft_val_fmt=journal&rft.genre=article&rft.jtitle=Management+Review&rft.atitle=Evolution+Inside+the+Boardrooms&rft.au=Ettorre%2C+Barbara.&rft.aulast=Ettorre&rft.aufirst=Barbara&rft.date=1992-10-01&rft.volume=81&rft.issue=10&rft.spage=10&rft.isbn=&rft.btitle=&rft.title=Management+Review&rft.issn=00251895&rft_id=info:doi/","2110:Boards of directors; 2400:Public relations; 9190:United States; Accountability; Activists; Board of directors; Boards of directors; Business And Economics--Labor And Industrial Relations; Capital structure; Chairman of the board; Chief executive officers; Conflicts of interest; Corporate governance; Corporate management; Directors; Evolution; Executive compensation; Inside; Outside directors; Power; Proxy solicitation; Proxy statements; Shareholder activism; Shareholder relations; Shareholders rights; Stockholders; US","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Historically, figures such as Julian Smith, of the Outdoor Education Project of the 1950's, advocated hunting as a critical element of educating children and youth about care and protection of natural resources. Henry David Thoreau saw hunting experiences as a means of becoming acquainted with nature. As with any human activity, hunting is engaged in by individuals with varying degrees of interest, competence, and responsibility. Because there are between 16 and 18 million licensed hunters in the United States, there is an implied obligation for outdoor educators to work toward educating hunters to live up to the highest standards of ethical behavior. Animal rights activists and anti-hunting groups have disseminated teaching materials to schools which emphasize simplistic and moralistic approaches in dealing with complex ecological, biological, social, and economic issues. Research has found a definite relationship between hunting and rural tradition and identified three types of hunters based on motivations for hunting and attitudes toward wildlife: meat hunters, sports hunters, and nature hunters. Nature hunters primarily hunt to be outdoors in the natural environment, and have a strong concern about and affection for the environment. All types of hunters scored higher than those who oppose hunting in factual understanding of animals. Decker found that hunters mature in their goal orientation from achievement and affiliative toward appreciative orientations. This paper contains 32 references.

At a minimum, CEOs are now spokespersons on public policy issues that are relevant to the company.  In some cases, CEOs have become political activists on those issues and become more directly involved in the political process.  Three forces are working today affecting the future role of public relations practitioners: 1.  identification and following of issues in corporate staffs prior to legislation, 2.  development of corporate policies and communicating those policies to change or block restrictive legislation, and 3.  the emergence of CEOs as spokespersons for the company and the assumption by the CEO of a direct involvement in issues of public policy.  Decisions on public policy issues are the responsibility of the CEO, and are usually made based on recommendations from the public relations or public affairs advisor.  Legal departments are often asked for advice also.  Many companies have established public issues committees, cutting across several department lines.  Indications are that CEOs are more reluctant to use outside public relations agencies for these new functions.","1982","2025-02-06 16:37:38","2025-02-06 16:37:38","","19","","2","27","","","","","","","","","","English","","","ABI/INFORM Collection","222489044; 00182845","","","Place: Rhinebeck Publisher: Public Relations Quarterly","","","https://libkey.io/libraries/3027/openurl?ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&ctx_enc=info:ofi/enc:UTF-8&rfr_id=info:sid/ProQuest&rft_val_fmt=journal&rft.genre=article&rft.jtitle=Public+Relations+Quarterly&rft.atitle=Communicating+on+Public+Issues%3A+A+Changing+Role+for+the+CEO&rft.au=Fox%2C+James+F.&rft.aulast=Fox&rft.aufirst=James&rft.date=1982-07-01&rft.volume=27&rft.issue=2&rft.spage=19&rft.isbn=&rft.btitle=&rft.title=Public+Relations+Quarterly&rft.issn=00333700&rft_id=info:doi/","2120:Chief executive officers; 2400:Public relations; 54182:Public Relations Agencies; Activism; Advertising And Public Relations; Chief executive officer; Chief executive officers; Polls & surveys; Public policy; Public relations; Public relations agencies; Responsibilities; Roles","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Foreign institutions and institutions from countries with strong shareholder protection play a role in promoting governance improvements outside of the U.S. Institutional investors affect not only which corporate governance mechanisms are in place, but also outcomes.

The results are robust after controlling for alternative explanations and mitigating endogeneity issues. Furthermore, the positive relationship between site visits and PPS is significant only for firms with more receptionists attending visits, more senior executives participating in investor receptions, and more site visits conducted in peak months. Mechanism analysis suggests that investors can motivate executives to take more risks and improve firm information transparency, ultimately increasing PPS.

As a result, boards of directors are dominated by insiders and/or represent the interests of the controlling shareholders. Our main finding is that CEO turnover is negatively related to firm performance also in this environment, but this relationship holds only if the controlling shareholder is not the CEO. Our findings suggest that insiders with large stakes monitor and replace under-performing outside CEOs.

Opponents of the SOP provision believe compensation contracting is better done by well-informed and unobstructed boards of directors. Our study provides direct evidence on the impact of the shareholder SOP votes by examining responses to the vote. We find that overcompensated managers with low SOP support tend to react by increasing dividends, decreasing leverage and increasing corporate investment. However, we find no evidence that management's response to the vote affects subsequent vote outcomes, nor do we find a subsequent change in firm value. Finally, we find excess compensation increases for managers that were substantially overpaid prior to the SOP vote, regardless of the outcome of the vote.

We find evidence of activist investors throughout the sample period and their impact is consistently significant in multivariate analysis. In contrast, voting with their feet has declined to the point where it no longer affects turnover outcomes. Nonetheless, activism is fairly uncommon and does not explain the higher turnover observed over time. Block holdings of known activists have increased and are linked to improving target firms. However, other blocks merely reflect the increasing size of institutional money managers. Going forward, the increasing size of institutional investors seems likely to inhibit voting with their feet while activism remains an important vehicle for change.","2012-02-01","2025-02-06 20:00:27","2025-02-06 21:08:37","","22-37","","1","18","","Journal of Corporate Finance","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Activists; CEO turnover; Exit; Governance; Institutional investors","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Firstly, mesostructured 3D TiO2 films with high surface area and thermally stable have been prepared. Secondly, CeO2 was deposited on 3D mesoporous TiO2 film by two pathways: (i) cerium nitrate sol in presence of poly(ethylene glycol) was deposited on the prepared mesoporous TiO2 films by spin-coating to obtain 1, 3, and 5 layers CeO2/TiO2 and (ii) the second pathway, for thick CeO2, the prepared mesoporous TiO2 films were suspended into the high concentration of cerium nitrate in presence of poly(ethylene glycol) for 24h with magnetic stirring. FE-SEM images of the mesoporous CeO2/TiO2 films were crack-free and indicated a random worm-like network of the mesopores. The XRD patterns show for all prepared samples only TiO2 anatase phase. At five layers CeO2/TiO2, a weak and diffuse diffraction peak arises, corresponding to (111) plane of cubic CeO2. Methylene blue degradation was conducted to characterize the photocatalytic activity of films and compared with that of commercially available Pilkington Activ™ glass by the determination of their photonic efficiencies. Photonic efficiency of mesoporous TiO2∼3.39% is higher than Pilkington Activ™ glass∼10 times, probably due to the much larger surface area of the mesoporous films and its high crystallinity. Five layers CeO2/TiO2 films showed two times higher photoactivity for MB oxidation than mesoporous TiO2 film, and its photonic efficiency was found to be ∼20 times higher than Pilkington Activ™ glass.

Two-stage least squares (2SLS) regressions show that over-paid CEOs are more likely to invest in R&D projects. They highlight, moreover, both from a “statutory” and an “activist” perspective, that CEOs’ intends to invest in value-enhancing innovations are contingent upon compensation committee independence and investor protection level. Check tests reveal that the pay-performance “innovation” effect for option-based compensation is higher than that for stock-based compensation. Within the options (stocks) rewards, unvested options (restricted stocks) are the most effective. However, we find that over-paid CEOs of low-growth firms achieve less innovation compared to those of high-growth firms. Throughout, we reveal that the effect of CEOs performance-pay on innovation is mainly relevant among overconfident managers than non-overconfident ones. Resumen El presente artículo se basa en el nivel salarial de los directores generales que más cobran, y hemos denominado “Nivel Organizativo de Director General” (en adelante, NODG) a fin de responder si los directores generales mejor remunerados invierten más en proyectos de innovación. Las regresiones de mínimos cuadrados en dos fases demuestran que los directores generales mejor remunerados son más proclives a invertir en proyectos de I y D. Dichas regresiones destacan, tanto desde una perspectiva “reglamentaria” como desde una “activista”, que la intención de los directores generales de invertir en innovaciones con valor añadido están supeditadas a la independencia del comité de compensación y al nivel de protección del inversor. Las pruebas de control revelan que el efecto “innovación” en el sueldo-rendimiento para la remuneración con base en acciones es superior al de la remuneración con base en opciones. Dentro de los incentivos en acciones, aquellas sin derecho de posesión (acciones restringidas) son las más efectivas. No obstante, observamos que los directores generales mejor pagados en las empresas de bajo crecimiento consiguen menos innovación que aquellos de las empresas con un mayor crecimiento. En todo momento, hemos observado que el efecto sueldo-rendimiento de los directores generales sobre la innovación es mucho más marcado entre los jefes con gran confianza en sí mismos.","2013-12-01","2025-02-06 20:00:27","2025-02-06 20:00:27","","63-71","","35","18","","Journal of Economics Finance and Administrative Science","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Chief Executive Officer compensation; Citas de patentes; Executive Director's Organizational Level; Gasto en investigación y desarrollo; Nivel Organizativo de Director General; Patent citations; Patentes; Patents; Remuneración del director general; Research and Development expenditures","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We focus on the following question: What are the antecedents of hedge fund activism in French listed firms? Hedge funds pursuing activist strategies tend to reduce management discretion in order to improve wealth creation in target firms. Since large shareholders can expropriate minority shareholders by neutralizing governance mechanisms which attempt to discipline management, we focus on the relationship between corporate governance and hedge fund activism in French listed target firms. Drawing on a total population of 36 French listed firms from 1998 to 2013, we propose a model based on an integrated approach to take into account the specificity of the French context. We find a significant relationship between the probability that a firm is targeted by a HF and determinants of HF activism, such as voting rights concentration, institutional and employee voting rights, firm size, debt ratio, operating performance, quality of information disclosure, proportion of independent directors and CEO duality.","2017-12-01","2025-02-06 20:00:27","2025-02-06 21:08:18","","1315-1326","","","42","","Research in International Business and Finance","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Activism; Corporate governance; Hedge funds","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Many people are simply fed up with the current state of affairs and want to see people in power held accountable. As a result, CEOs are taking public stances on timely issues. They are doing so not only because they want to win favor with their employees and customers but also because they feel an obligation—and pressure—to speak up and pursue greater good on behalf of others since they have platforms and visibility that are not shared by those whose lack similar status or vehicles to for their voices to be heard. This is a qualitative study that involved in-depth interviews with 24 CEO activists. Data analysis followed the hermeneutic phenomenological approach. The findings advance the CEO activism literature by focusing on the tactical repertoire of activist CEOs within the non-Western context of Ghana. Activist CEOs in Ghana use a broader portfolio of tactics than previously thought, offer a typology of CEO activism tactics, and help to internationalize CEO activism research.

While some upper echelons leaders initiate activism efforts in a way that strengthens their firms, others are struggling to do so without risking brand and business performance. This research addresses this important managerial challenge by conceptualizing activism through a risk paradigm. To do this, we first introduce and define a construct called Enterprise Activism. The construct comprises all forms of firm-initiated activism which can impact brand and business performance, such as brand activism, CEO activism, and corporate activism, regardless of who is making the decision (e.g., Chief Marketing Officer or store manager) or whether a portfolio brand or the corporate brand is involved (e.g., Harris Teeter or the corporate brand, Kroger). We then conceptualize the Enterprise Activism Risk Model, providing insight into how different types of actions can pose market share and positional advantage risks. Leveraging insight from C-level leaders, we identify ways that firm leaders can deploy the model to advance business practice. Finally, we provide a research agenda to develop new theory and evidence to help support and improve practice.

Our findings are robust to propensity score matching, instrumental variable estimation and the exogenous shock of mandatory online voting. Moreover, independent directors facing dissent are more likely to vote against board proposals and to reduce their absences from board meetings. The mechanism analysis shows that shareholder dissent operates through the reputation concern and market signal channels. The effect of dissent is more prominent for non-SOEs, for firms with more high-profile directors, and for firms with less powerful CEOs.

This study hypothesizes that public naming by CalPERS damages the reputations of management and directors at these companies, and these companies respond by improving their corporate governance. This hypothesis is supported by three findings. First, companies are more likely to decrease the number of inside directors after being named publicly by CalPERS. A large proportion of departing inside directors remains full-time employees in the named companies. Second, departing inside directors are less likely to take up future directorships after their companies are named publicly by CalPERS.

These three findings are consistent with the hypothesis that CalPERS influences public opinion and that reputation concerns are effective in compelling companies to improve their corporate governance system.","2004-01-01","2025-02-06 20:00:27","2025-02-06 21:08:35","","199-227","","1","10","","Journal of Corporate Finance","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","CalPERS; Corporate governance; Public opinion","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Chief Human Resource Officers (CHROs) have a potentially important role in defining and promoting appropriate human resource practices through human resource disclosures in corporate annual reports. We empirically examine the effect of CHROs on expanded human capital resource (HCR) disclosures, recently mandated by the SEC. We find that CHROs have a greater effect on the quality of HCR disclosures when they belong to the top management team, and less so when they belong to groups that are more poorly represented in top management, such as women, racial or ethnic minorities, or non-US nationals, and CHROs holding a liberal arts degree. Jointly considering the characteristics of CHROs, CEOs, and CFOs, we additionally find that pro-democratic political ideology is related to higher quality HCR disclosures. This study contributes to the literature by introducing a generalizable measure of HCR disclosure quality, uncovering significant heterogeneity in HCR disclosure quality across large US firms, and highlighting the role of CHROs in this process. In doing so, this study documents evidence that individual top executives in addition to the CEO and CFO can have a measurable effect on voluntary financial disclosures.","2023-05-01","2025-02-06 20:00:27","2025-02-06 21:08:23","","107083","","3","42","","Journal of Accounting and Public Policy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Despite the aggregate M&A market amounting to several trillions USD on an annual basis, acquiring firms often underperform relative to non-acquiring firms, especially in public takeovers. Although hundreds of academic studies have investigated the deal- and firm-level factors associated with M&A announcement returns, short-run returns are often not sustained in the long run. Moreover, the wide variety of performance measures and heterogeneity in sample sizes complicates the drawing of accurate and unambiguous conclusions. In this light, our survey compiles the recent literature and aims to identify the areas of research for which short-run returns predict (or fail to predict) long-run performance. We find that post-takeover deal performance is affected by key determinants including serial acquisitions, CEO overconfidence, acquirer-target relatedness and complementarity, and shareholder intervention in the form of voting or activism.","2019-10-01","2025-02-06 20:00:27","2025-02-06 21:08:27","","650-699","","","58","","Journal of Corporate Finance","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Corporate governance; Long-run performance; Mergers and acquisitions; Takeovers","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Our evidence supports the hypothesis that these firms are financially constrained. Zero-debt firms are small, young, conserve cash from cash-flow, and are more likely to lease their assets. When they have access to a line of credit, they face stricter covenants and higher all-in costs than comparable control firms.

The secondary sources included news reports, industry reports, company websites, annual reports and company websites. Case overview/synopsis: The case discusses the comprehensive renewable energy transition strategy that Lynn J. Good (Good), CEO and President of Duke Energy and the Chairman of its Board, was undertaking. In September 2019, Good revealed a new climate plan aimed at achieving net-zero carbon emissions with zero methane emissions from natural gas operations by 2030 and zero carbon emissions from electricity generation by 2050. Duke Energy is a Fortune 150 company headquartered in Charlotte, North Carolina and one of the major energy generation companies in the USA with two reportable business segments – Electric Utilities and Infrastructure (EU&I) and Gas Utilities and Infrastructure (GU&I). Good targeted interim carbon emission reduction targets of at least 50% from electric generation by 2030, 50% for Scope 2 and some Scope 3 upstream and downstream emissions by 2035 and 80% from electric generation by 2040. To achieve this, she invested in large electric grid upgrades and energy storage, as well as in research on zero-emission power generation technologies including hydrogen and advanced nuclear technologies. She helped update the grid system and improved customer experience. As part of the revamped climate strategy, Good invested in crucial energy infrastructure and improved affordability of electricity for customers, especially in the North Carolina region. Despite her efforts at curbing emissions, Good faced criticism from various quarters. This included criticism of Duke’s carbon-cutting plans in 2022 in its core North and South Carolina service zones. The company also faced charges of environmental pollution. Its 2024 strategy, which aimed to address a projected increase in demand for electricity using natural gas plants capable of running on hydrogen, was also met with skepticism by industry groups, advocates, activists and local governments. Good had to face the conflict between environmental ambitions and technological realities that highlighted the difficulties in transitioning to a cleaner energy future. It remained to be seen whether she would be able to successfully navigate the various hurdles and help Duke Energy reach its 2030 emission targets.

Purpose of the paper: The aim of our paper is to shed light on how the cultural tensions of being a socio-political activist and an iconic fashion entrepreneur in the current scenario of consumer movements and collective agitations are constructed and amplified in social media platforms. Methodology: We developed an in-depth critical case centered on Vivienne Westwood as person, leader, and brand. We adopted a netnographic research design that combined a diachronic, retrospective, and auto-biographical reconstruction of Vivienne Westwood’s life story, with non-participant observation of online posts, conversations, and comments centered on Westwood as person and as brand, shared on social media platforms. Results: Our study highlights a series of clashes that arise when an activist leader does not act as a true ethical leader of meanings and does not use engaging, and fine-tuning communication as a strategic lever to transform society through listening to, engaging, and fine-tuning with stakeholders, but rather indulges in a self-referential attitude aimed at giving full expression to her changing moods, needs, and desires. Practical implications: This paper highlights the challenges of being an activist leader and brand in contemporary woke society. In so doing, it provides strategic guidelines on how communication should be conceived in the company to achieve ethical leadership and overcome cultural tensions. Originality of the paper: This paper contributes to advance brand and CEO activism as well as strategic communication theoretical debate, through explicitly linking the tensions and the clashes between authentic purpose and commodified market logics emerging in social media platforms to a lack of exercise of ethical communication leadership on the part of the brand leader. © 2024 Fondazione Cueim.

Analyzing 10 years of corporate communication by Blackrock CEO Larry Fink, we show how his corporate activist rhetoric suggests a growing disregard for dialogic communication, which is typically articulated within American public relations scholarship as a vital component in, for example, Grunig’s Excellence Theory and Heath’s rhetorical perspectives. This analysis of Fink’s communication further suggests the need for American public relations scholarship to move beyond a false binary between external and internal approaches to activism, which is further complicated by Fink’s seeming lack of interest in dialogic communication. Relatedly, we note that the mainstream conception of public relations as a consensus-oriented, good faith exchange seems at odds with the emerging reality of a societal disposition for mere assertions.

Engaging in such activism could be risky for executives, given its potential to appease some stakeholders while alienating others. This begs the question: Why do some CEOs become sociopolitical activists while others remain on the “sidelines”? This study addresses this question by exploring the notion of the executive “bully pulpit” and how CEOs leverage their status and reputation to publicly engage in sociopolitical activism. Research Findings/Insights: Drawing from the status and reputation literature, we explore the effect of CEO power, CEO celebrity status, and firm reputation as predictors of CEO sociopolitical activism. In doing so, we focus on the “bully pulpit” explanation by arguing that powerful, high-status CEOs and those who lead firms with good reputations are more likely to use their professional position and visibility to advocate for or against controversial sociopolitical issues. Our analysis of CEO sociopolitical activism data from 246 matched-pair S&P 500 firms from 2007 to 2020 largely supports our arguments, though we find there is an important interaction between firm reputation and both CEO power and celebrity. Theoretical/Academic Implications: This study extends current research insights by highlighting how power, status, and reputation at the CEO and firm levels create a formidable platform (a “bully pulpit”) from which executive sociopolitical activism is exercised. Given its nascent nature, scholars are just beginning to empirically explore the consequences of CEO sociopolitical activism. This study contributes to ongoing work in this area by providing empirical evidence on the nature and drivers of CEO sociopolitical activism. Practitioner/Policy Implications: Firms seeking to play a more proactive role in contemporary sociopolitical issues need to consider hiring high-profile CEOs. Additionally, highly reputed firms are well-positioned to support their CEOs' efforts in influencing societal debates on controversial issues. © 2024 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","2024","2025-02-06 20:06:44","2025-02-06 21:08:34","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Code: Corporate Governance: An International Review Type: Article","","","","CEO activism; corporate governance; power; reputation; stakeholder theory; status","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This event severely damaged BP's corporate standing, and the company's response and management of the crisis and cleanup exacerbated the damage to BP's reputation. The company's crisis communication strategies failed amid an onslaught of online and social media commentary from traditionally passive stakeholders and activists. The resultant damage to the company's reputation saw $95B wiped off the company's equity value and the CEO forced to resign. It is shown that crisis planning needs to be continually reviewed to take account of the evolving nature of social media during a crisis; in this instance, the use of Twitter proved particularly damaging to BP.

However, the pressure seems to be more on large-scale companies to make progress and have an elaborate vision and goals related to environmental issues than small and medium enterprises (SMEs). This case deals with the sustainability focus of the CEO of Ruscombe Artisan Food & Drink Ltd.

There is, however, scant research on how, if at all, listed South African FFs differ from their non-family counterparts concerning board composition and independence. The purpose of this study was to address this knowledge gap by investigating director and chair independence, chair-chief executive officer (CEO) role duality, board race and gender diversity, as well as board rotation at FFs listed on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange (JSE) over the period 2006 to 2022. The study was informed by the agency, socioemotional wealth, and stewardship theories. Design/methodology/approach: Data were collected on 753 directors who served on the boards of 37 JSE-listed FFs. Data sources included Bloomberg and the FFs’ integrated reports and websites. Data were analysed by examining trends in the considered variables over time. Findings/results: While family involvement at board level remained relatively constant, considerably fewer family members served as board chairs and CEOs towards the end of the research period. Board independence increased significantly over the research period. Practical implications: Shareholder activists’ requests for improved board governance of JSE-listed FFs seem justified. Activists should, however, also consider the benefits of family stewardship when evaluating director and chair independence in these firms. This study also identifies practical implications for nomination committees and investor education. Originality/value: The use of multiple theoretical lenses provides a balanced view of board governance at JSE-listed FFs. The study contributes to the scant body of knowledge on board composition and independence in listed FFs in South Africa, which will enable future FF research. © 2024.

Financial reporting performs an important societal role by helping control agency problems that arise from the separation of ownership and management. Since external stakeholders cannot “observe directly the extent and quality of managerial effort on their behalf […] the manager may be tempted to shirk […] blaming any deterioration of firm performance on factors beyond his/her control” (Scott, 2014, p. 23). However, although financial reporting helps hold managers accountable to shareholders, accounting information is not fully informative about managerial effort. For example, while net income provides useful information regarding the CEO’s stewardship, it is also “noisy,” due to recognition lags and other factors (Scott, 2014, p. 364). Efforts undertaken by Thompson in a particular period, such as marketing expenditures, might reduce current earnings, yet boost future profitability. Additionally, Thompson’s predecessor’s past efforts might have positive or negative effects on current earnings. Evaluating stewardship effectively involves considerable judgment, in addition to knowledge of financial accounting. The implication of poor firm performance is that the CEO is ineffective at formulating and implementing strategies and policies to enhance firm value (Dikolli et al., 2014). Specifically, it appears that missing earnings benchmarks matter more for relatively inexperienced CEOs. Don Thompson’s tenure of 33 months at McDonalds is 42 percent lower than median CEO tenure documented in academic research, where the median tenure of chief executives documented in large sample empirical studies is about 57 months (Dikolli et al., 2014). The evidence suggests that the longer a CEO serves, the less likely he is to be dismissed for performance-related reasons. This appears to be the result of the resolution of uncertainty about CEO’s ability and leads to subsequent declines in the level of monitoring by the Board of Directors. Performance evaluation and bias: a significant body of research explores the extent to which female managers are assessed differently than their male counterparts (Powell and Butterfield, 2002). For example, female CEOs face more threats from activist investors than male CEOs. Therefore, even after women achieve the highest managerial rank, they experience more professional challenges than their male counterparts (Gupta et al., 2018). However, the question of whether black CEOs are assessed differently is more challenging to answer empirically as a result of a smaller sample size (only one percent of S&P 500 companies are run by black CEOs). Our case attempts to develop the inference that if female CEOs are subject to bias, analogous forces are likely at work when black CEOs are assessed. Recent evidence further suggests that business students sometimes demonstrate bias in making assessments (Mengel et al., 2018). The authors discuss these findings – as well as strategies for including them in the case discussion – in the “Teaching Strategy” section herein below. Research methodology: The case was written from the public record surrounding the appointment of Don Thompson and McDonald’s company filings. The record includes articles from The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal, as well as local and industry publications. Case overview/synopsis: The case examines the role of financial accounting in evaluating CEO performance in the context of the appointment of McDonald’s first African-American chief executive and his subsequent two-and-a-half years on the job. The case deepens students’ understanding of the link between financial reporting and stewardship, while highlighting the subjectivity inherent in assessing managerial performance, particularly over relatively short time periods. As students analyze the case, they must consider the extent to which a firm’s results are attributable to luck vs skill. We use “skill” to refer to CEO effort and other controllable factors, while “luck” refers to exogenous factors, such as macroeconomic conditions. Assessing stewardship is of practical significance. It allows pay to be better aligned with performance and empowers stakeholders to identify when a change of leadership may be warranted. The case may also be used to spur reflection, in an applied context, on the importance of being alert to unconscious bias, even when evaluating seemingly objective financial reporting data. Recent research, discussed herein, suggests that business students sometimes exhibit bias when making assessments. Complexity academic level: The case should be included in discussions of corporate governance, executive compensation and the role of accounting information in efficient contracting. It is appropriate in intermediate financial accounting courses for undergraduates, introductory graduate accounting courses, or other courses with an element of financial statement analysis. Standard introductory accounting textbooks offer helpful supplementary reading for students. Horngren et al.’s (2014) book, Introduction to Financial Accounting (12th ed.), Pearson, London, provides an overview of the income statement and its role in assessing performance (see Chapter 2) as well as a useful discussion on evaluating the components and trends of a business (see Chapter 12). More advanced students may benefit from the in-depth discussion of earnings quality, operating income and non-operating income found in Chapter 4 of Intermediate Accounting (9th ed.), McGraw Hill Education, New York by Spiceland et al.

These competing expectations have created a scenario where engaging, not engaging, or incorrectly engaging in CEO activism all carry the risk of alienating at least some stakeholders and undermining CEO and firm reputation and performance. Further, extant research has primarily focused on whether CEOs engage in activism rather than disentangling the heterogeneous ways by which they do so. We address these shortcomings and augment existing theory by comprehensively considering distinct CEO activism engagement strategies, their outcomes, and the moderators influencing relations between the two. Moreover, we illuminate the highly heterogeneous nature of CEO activism to better capture the phenomenon’s complexity. We first introduce the CEO Activism Decision Matrix—a typology of four unique activism engagement strategies based on the behavioral dimensions of CEO Talk (leveraging communicative power) and CEO Action (leveraging economic power), successfully addressing the heterogeneity in activism behaviors that existing theory has overlooked. We then present an integrative conceptual model that outlines the short- and long-term consequences and relevant moderators of CEO activism engagement and offer detailed recommendations for future research, including methodological guidance on operationalizing variables and designing research that can infer causality. Altogether, we demonstrate that although CEOs may find themselves “damned if you do, and damned if you don’t” engage in activism, they also have the potential to drive meaningful career, firm, and societal change based on how they choose to engage. © The Author(s) 2024.","2024","2025-02-06 20:06:44","2025-02-06 20:06:44","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Code: Group and Organization Management Type: Article","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In an experiment with 4,578 respondents, we study the effect of CEO activism on people’s willingness to contact their U.S. senators about abortion. On average, showing a CEO message supporting abortion rights is not more effective at mobilizing pro-choice citizens than showing no message or showing a message from other speakers. Additionally, CEOs do not provoke countermobilization by people who oppose abortion. We explore heterogeneous treatment effects and find that CEO activism is better at motivating pro-choice citizens to engage in politics when their senators are Democrats and thus likely receptive to pro-choice activism, consistent with stakeholder alignment theory.

This study examined the impact of these factors on public responses. An online experiment was conducted using a randomized 2 (issue maturity: controversial vs. matured issue) x 2 (communication about motivation: society-serving vs. society- and firm-serving) full factorial design, drawing on samples of general consumers.

Specifically, we find that opposition to shareholder proposals varies positively with CEOs’ contributions to the moratorium co-sponsors. However, opposition varies positively with PAC contributions to co-sponsors only when the targeted CEO contributes to the PAC.

All sources are cited in the case narrative and as end notes. Case overview/synopsis: In April 2022, The Walt Disney Company and its CEO, Robert Chapek, were at the center of a controversy over the company’s opposition to the State of Florida’s Parental Rights in Education bill. The bill, dubbed “Don’t Say Gay” by its critics, prohibited instruction on sexual identity and gender orientation in the state’s elementary schools. The controversy stemmed from Disney’s initial non-reaction to the bill and its later strident opposition and call for its repeal. Chapek was pressured by negative media publicity and employee disgruntlement on the one hand and adverse economic consequences for opposing the bill by the state’s Governor, Ron DeSantis. Chapek and the Board had to respond to the political threats to Disney’s economic well-being while appeasing its employees and other stakeholders who wanted the company to be a corporate champion in diversity, equity and inclusion. Complexity academic level: The case is best suited for advanced undergraduate or graduate leadership, strategic management and marketing courses. From a leadership and strategic management perspective, the case is well-suited for demonstrating the evolving expectations of leaders and corporate social responsibility, as well as the concepts of issue framing and nonmarket management.

It holds that corporations should communicate in ways that advocate for racial justice, attempt to improve race relations, and support achieving a more equitable and harmonious society. Corporations have this responsibility to race because they have historically perpetuated and profited from racial oppression, making corporations contributors to, and benefactors of, racial injustice. However, recently corporations have been using their platforms to speak against racial injustice in an effort to improve race relations. CRR theory provides a new way to readily identify, understand, contextualize, theorize and analyze corporate communication about race. Although CRR emerges from a Unites States perspective, and as a public relations concept, it has global applications in any place where racial difference leads to oppression, and it has analytical value in any field where organizational resources can be leveraged to fight oppression. © 2021 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","2021","2025-02-06 20:06:44","2025-02-06 20:06:44","","6 – 22","","1","33","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Code: Journal of Public Relations Research Type: Article","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Globally, trust is stagnating; in the USA, it has collapsed altogether. The corporate reputation bubble has burst, and with it, people’s trust that organisations will do the right thing. The flipside of these issues is an opportunity for companies to take action to restore trust and enhance reputation. At the top of the list is strong corporate purpose — the new business imperative that is quickly becoming today’s clarion call. Unlike traditional corporate social responsibility, a moral purpose should reflect a company’s DNA, serving as a natural extension of its business, addressing a societal problem like climate change or world hunger. Another area involves a renewed focus on earned media. Society is now looking to experts like trusted journalists as sources of credible information; companies must continue to cultivate relationships with them in order to tell their stories through respected media channels. There is also a new expectation for chief executives, who now must play the role of chief values officer and demonstrate activism for relevant causes to enhance reputation.

It introduces a model for selecting activism topics, emphasizing issue maturity and congruence as critical factors. The study investigates how topic selection influences public trust in CEO activism and perceptions of CEO leadership, ultimately impacting public support for the advocated issue and company loyalty. Design/methodology/approach: A randomized 2 × 2 experiment was conducted: issue maturity (mature vs controversial) and issue-company congruence (high vs low). Findings: Generally, CEO activism on mature issues fostered greater public trust and favorable evaluations of transformational leadership compared to controversial issues. However, issue-company congruency significantly moderated these effects. Mature, high-congruence issues led to increased trust, positive leadership evaluations and greater advocacy and company loyalty. In contrast, mature issues with low congruency did not yield the same positive outcomes. Controversial issues with high congruency resulted in the lowest levels of trust, potentially leading to backlash and diminished the positive impact of CEO activism. Originality/value: The results underscore the importance of strategic issue selection for CEO activism. Carefully chosen topics, considering both issue maturity and company-issue congruence, can effectively garner public support for the sociopolitical issue the CEO is advocating for while simultaneously enhancing perceptions of the CEO’s leadership and fostering company loyalty. © 2024, Emerald Publishing Limited.","2024","2025-02-06 20:06:44","2025-02-06 20:06:44","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Code: Corporate Communications Type: Article","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Moreover, positive responses are concentrated in firms facing greater pressure from peers, the market, and the regulator.

Case overview/synopsis: January 7, 2021, was not a good day for Goya Foods CEO Robert Bob Unanue, who has been at the helm of Goya since 2004. On that day, the nine-member board of directors of Goya censured Unanue for publicly questioning the legitimacy of the 2021 United States Presidential election. A day before, on January 6, a mob “trapped lawmakers and vandalized the home of Congress in the worst desecration of the complex since British forces burned it in 1814” (Hockstein, 2021). Unanue was considered a follower of former president Trump and has expressed that “the country was […] blessed to have a leader like President Trump, who is a builder” (Hawkins, 2020). In January 2021, Unanue appeared on Fox News and said a “ war was coming,” as Joe Biden’s election was “unverified.” These, among other words, motivated the censured by the board of Goya Foods, Inc. (Santana and Isidore, 2021). Students are asked the following questions for discussion: Did the board of directors of Goya Foods carry its role too far by openly censuring Unanue? Did Unanue go too far by openly expressing subjective opinions and thus influencing how people view the election results? Should he have remained as CEO of Goya Foods after his words on Joe Biden’s election?

In addition, there is weak evidence of greater announcement returns when the board includes a greater number of insiders, CEO ownership is high, and director and officer (excluding CEO) ownership is low. © 2013, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","2015","2025-02-06 20:06:44","2025-02-06 20:06:44","","641 – 660","","4","39","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Code: Journal of Economics and Finance Type: Article","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Individual aspects of the board have increasingly been the focus of policy reform and shareholder activism. Specific attributes of board structure like the separation of the posts of chairperson and the CEO, percentage of outside directors on the board, etc., have become important considerations in the quest for effective corporate governance. In contrast, taking a process view of corporate governance, this article examines the utility of shareholder value analysis for corporate governance. In value-based management, shareholder value maximization is set as the objective of the firm. The adoption of this objective as the goal of the firm can promote effective corporate governance in three ways. First, it provides the necessary ‘pre-commitment’ between shareholders and managers regarding the goal of the firm. Second, it necessitates a greater flow of firm-specific information and the disaggregation of financial information. In corporate governance a clear identification of the goal of the firm and firm-specific information is important because of the incomplete contracts between shareholders and managers. Substantive flows of firm-specific information are needed to bridge the gaps in the incomplete contracts. Shareholder value management techniques, by providing this information in a non-agency context can provide a valuable input towards effective corporate governance. Finally, the goal of shareholder wealth maximization ensures a closer interdependence between strategy formation and the setting of operational objectives for managerial decisions. We illustrate some of these points with examples from the Lloyds–TSB experience of implementing shareholder value analysis and the findings of a study on investor communication. © 2006, Sage Publications India Pvt.

Positioned as an expression of personal morality, such activism is potentially highly influential because of CEOs' public visibility and associated positional and resource-based power. This paper questions the assumption that CEO activism can only be explained in relation to individual moral action, and illuminates its wider social implications. We critically evaluate the recent upsurge in CEO activism by juxtaposing it against broader social activism, identifying its distinctive characteristics, and empirically examining two recent 'moral episodes': the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program and the Fetal Heartbeat Acts (FHAs). Our analysis demonstrates that CEO activism is more heterogeneous than research to date has shown. Building on this analysis, a refined understanding of the character and morality of CEO activism is developed by establishing a typology of its forms. We conclude that while CEO activism is an important and potent new phenomenon, it may not be universally appropriate to regard CEOs as moral leaders. Instead, it is paramount to question the motives and effects of what CEOs do in the name of morality.]","2021","2025-02-06 20:23:17","2025-02-06 20:23:17","2025-02-06","269-285","","2","170","","","","","","","","","","","","","JSTOR","","","","Publisher: Springer","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Yet while there is a common core of rules, considerable differences remain, not only in the details, but sometimes also regarding main issues. These differences depend partly on shareholder structure (dispersed or blockholding), partly on path dependent historical, political and social developments, especially on the question of employee representation on the board. More recently, in particular in the wake of the rise of the international corporate governance code movement there has been a clear tendency towards convergence, at least in terms of the formal provisions of the codes. This article analyzes the corporate boards, their regulation in law and codes, and their actual functioning in nine European countries (Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Poland, Sweden, Switzerland and the United Kingdom) from a functional and comparative perspective. Issues dealt with are inter alia board structure, composition and functioning (one tier v. two tier, independent directors, expertise and diversity, separating the chair and the CEO functions, information streams, committees, voting and employee representation); enforcement by liability rules (in particular in cases of conflicts of interest); incentive structures (remuneration); and share holder activism. The article finds convergence in these European countries resulting from the pressures of competition, a pro-shareholder trend supported by government and institutional investors and, to a certain degree, the impact of the EU. This convergence is more visible in the governance codes and the ensuing practice than in the statutory law. Still, considerable differences remain, in particular as a result of the failure to adopt a mandatory ""no frustration"" rule for takeovers at the EU level, and diverging systems of labor codetermination. The overall result is an unstable balance between convergence and divergence, shareholder and stakeholder influence, as well as European v. national rulemaking.]","2013","2025-02-06 20:23:17","2025-02-06 20:23:17","2025-02-06","301-375","","2","61","","","","","","","","","","","","","JSTOR","","","","Publisher: American Society of Comparative Law","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We examine the effect of different types of shock on the likelihood a top executive will exit their firm.

What studies we have?focused mainly on the activities of U.S. pension funds?show no clear effect on shareholder returns. But a new study of shareholder activism in the U.K. looks promising. The subject of the study is a ?Focus Fund,? launched in 1998 by the U.K. investment firm Hermes, whose aim is to identify underperforming companies, propose changes to their managements and boards, and?in contrast to the practices of the best-known U.S. shareholder activists?work mainly ?behind the scenes? with the companies to bring about those changes. In keeping with the more private nature of U.K. activism, which reflects in part the fewer restrictions on communication between companies and their investors than in the U S., the study's method of investigation is also notably different from the methods used in studies of U.S. investors. Four academics were allowed to examine Hermes' records of its ?engagements? with companies, including letters, recordings and transcripts of telephone conversations, and the staff's personal notes and recollections. Using this information, the researchers show that the Fund has been remarkably successful in bringing about three kinds of proposed changes: replacements of CEOs and Chairmen; changes in investment and financial policies (mainly increased payouts and more disciplined capital spending); and restructurings (typically leading to greater corporate focus). Of equal importance, the study also shows that the market reaction to the announcement of such changes has been significantly positive, and that the cumulative effect of these positive reactions accounts for as much as 90% of the Fund's impressive ?alpha,? or market out-performance, over its eight-year life. The first public presentation of these findings took place on February 9 at the inaugural event of the London Business School's Center for the Study of Corporate Governance. In our account of the event, an overview of the study's findings by two of its authors is followed by an ?insider's? view of the Hermes' success story (presented by the Chief Executive of the Fund from 2002?2004) and a panel discussion of the general import of the findings featuring four distinguished practitioners.","2006-03-01","2025-02-06 20:33:01","2025-02-06 20:33:01","2025-02-06","8-27","","2","18","","Journal of Applied Corporate Finance","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We use two experiments to examine how CEO (in)activism impacts investor decisions. Our results are consistent with our theoretical predictions. When a CEO expresses an activist position that is consistent versus inconsistent with investors' views, investors invest more in the CEO's firm because they perceive the CEO more positively. We also find that CEO inactivism can lead to investment decisions that are as favorable as when the CEO expresses a position consistent with investors' views; our process evidence suggests that this may occur because CEO inactivism increases the likelihood that investors believe the CEO shares their position on a social issue. Finally, we do not find evidence that investor decisions are influenced by whether CEO (in)activism is in response to an external prompt. This study contributes to the emerging literature on CEO activism, a unique form of voluntary disclosure, by providing evidence about how CEO (in)activism influences investors.

Millstein","Journal of Applied Corporate Finance","","1078-1196","10.1111/jacf.12216","https://doi.org/10.1111/jacf.12216","In this conversation held at the 2016 Millstein Governance Forum at Columbia Law School, Ira Millstein, a leading authority on corporate governance and founding chair of the Millstein Center for Global Markets and Corporate Ownership, discusses his new book, The Activist Director, with Geoff Colvin of Fortune Magazine. In explaining why he wrote the book, Millstein said that it is important for boards of directors to understand the key role they must play to secure the future of our corporations, and for shareholders to recognize, encourage, and support this role. The role of directors has changed significantly over the years. Yet corporate performance, broadly speaking, has not lived up to expectations, and Millstein attributes this in part to the failure of directors to adapt and evolve quickly and decisively enough?which in turn has helped to fuel the rise of activist investors. Much of the problem stems from the tendency of boards to view themselves as oversight organizations that review and ?challenge? management at arm's length, as opposed to truly engaging with management to make better decisions. To address this problem, Millstein makes the case for ?activist? directors who will partner with management, think deliberately and critically about the company's strategy, and work for the longterm interest of the corporation. And to provide financial incentives for directors to reinforce their commitment to the corporations they serve, Millstein favors an increase in compensation for directors that is tied to long-term performance. As an early example of what became an activist board, Millstein describes his own experience with the board of General Motors in the late 1980s and early 1990s when it confronted managerial failure and ended up replacing the CEO. In the current environment of activist investors, activist boards must give serious consideration to shareholder proposals for change, without succumbing to pressure for shortsighted cutbacks in value-adding investment and while ensuring that management is focused on long-term growth and innovation. Directors must have the courage and commitment to carry out the course of action they deem to be in the best longterm interests of the corporation.","2017-03-01","2025-02-06 20:33:13","2025-02-06 20:33:13","2025-02-06","10-14","","1","29","","Journal of Applied Corporate Finance","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Partly in response to these pressures, and in combination with a change in the tax code that encourages performance-based pay, corporate boards have dramatically increased their use of stock grants and executive stock options. Combine this development with the longest bull market in U.S. financial history, and the result is unprecedented levels of CEO pay at the close of the 20th century. This review of executive compensation reveals that the economic theory of tournaments may provide a rationale for the pattern, if not the level, of executive pay. Specifically it finds that the total compensation of the five highestpaid executives in a cross-section of new and old-economy firms is very similar to the pattern of payouts to players in a golf tournament. The author also reports that recent studies show a significant increase in the pay-for-performance correlation throughout the 1990s. But whether that correlation is as high as it should be, and whether current levels of CEO pay are socially ?optimal,? are questions that remain unanswered.","2001-09-01","2025-02-06 20:33:18","2025-02-06 20:33:18","2025-02-06","22-34","","3","14","","Journal of Applied Corporate Finance","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The paper argues that associations such as the BCA confront a range of serious institutional problems in their attempts to wield political power, or more modestly perhaps, policy influence. First, they confront a disconnect between ?structural? and ?instrumentalist? articulations of business power. The key source of business power resides in business control over the economy and the investment process, a form of power wielded at the company level not at the level of business associations. When engaged in instrumentalist or overt forms of political activism, the BCA also confronts serious collective action problems. It is also argued that the influence of the BCA seems to have declined over time and that this can partly be traced back to declining CEO commitment rooted in changing institutional and structural dynamics in the corporate world.

Thanks in part to the efforts of the ICGN and growing investor activism, U.K. companies have made ?a reasonably swift transition to a position where the majority of their boards are totally independent of management, and free of other potential conflicts of interest.? U.S. boards, by contrast, remain ?dominated by the imperial CEO? and ?have failed to rein in the ambitions and appetites of their CEOs in such circumstances.?

On the first of the three subjects, Robert Monks suggests that the U.S. should adopt the British convention of the ?extraordinary general meeting,? or ?EGM,? which gives a majority of shareholders who attend the meeting the right to remove any or all of a company's directors ?with or without cause.? Such shareholder meetings are permitted in virtually all developed economies outside the U.S. because, as Monks goes on to say, they represent ?a far more efficient and effective solution than the idea of having shareholders nominate people for the simple reason that even very involved, financially sophisticated fiduciaries are not the best people to nominate directors.? Moreover, according to both Jensen and Monks, corporate boards in the U.K. do a better job than their U.S. counterparts of monitoring top management on behalf of shareholders. In contrast to the U.S., where the majority of companies continue to be run by CEO/Chairmen, over 90% of English companies are now chaired by outside directors, contributing to ?a culture of independent-minded chairmen capable of providing a high level of oversight.? In the U.S., by contrast, most corporate directors continue to view themselves as ?employees of the CEO.? And, as a result, U.S. boards generally fail to exercise effective oversight and control until outside forces?often in the form of activist investors such as hedge funds and private equity?bring about a ?crisis.? In companies owned and run by private equity firms, by contrast, top management is vigorously monitored and controlled by a board made up of the firm's largest investors. And the fact that the rewards to the operating heads of successful private equity-controlled firms are typically multiples of those received by comparably effective public company CEOs suggests that the problem with U.S. CEO pay is not its level, but its lack of correlation with performance.","2008-12-01","2025-02-06 20:33:19","2025-02-06 20:33:19","2025-02-06","28-46","","1","20","","Journal of Applied Corporate Finance","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Roe argues that current U.S. corporate structures are the result not only of such economic factors, but of political forces that restricted the size and activities of U.S. commercial banks and other financial intermediaries. Populist fears of concentrated economic power, interest group maneuvering, and a federalist American political structure all had a role in pressuring Congress to fragment U.S. financial institutions and limit their ability to own stock and participate in corporate governance. Had U.S. politics been different, the present ownership structure of some American public companies might have been different. Truly national U.S. financial institutions might have been able to participate as substantial owners in the wave of end-of-the-century mergers and then use their large blocks of stock to sit on the boards of the merged enterprises (much as Warren Buffett, venture capitalists, and LBO firms like KKR do today). Such a concentrated ownership and governance structure might have helped to address monitoring, information, and coordination problems that continue to reduce the value of some U.S. companies. The recent increase in the activism of U.S. institutional investors also casts doubt on the standard explanation of American corporate ownership structure. The new activism of U.S. financial institutions-primarily pension funds and mutual funds-can be interpreted as the delayed outbreak of an impulse to participate in corporate ownership and governance that was historically suppressed by American politics.","1997-01-01","2025-02-06 20:33:19","2025-02-06 20:33:19","2025-02-06","8-22","","4","9","","Journal of Applied Corporate Finance","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Regulations expanded faster than corporate culture could adjust. Spurred by public activism, it became essential for politicians to ?do something? about the environment. And they did with a vengeance. By the late 1980s, nearly every company had an environmental program. The stand-alone environmental department was ubiquitous. Expensive, rigid, command and control management was established to reduce liability exposure. As we enter the twenty-first century, this is simply not good enough. These management structures are significant cost centers. They are unable to effect continuous improvement. They place their organizations at a competitive disadvantage in the global marketplace. To reduce costs, gain efficiency, and continue to reduce exposure, corporations must adjust their cultures. Environmental compliance must become integrated vertically through the entire structure, from CEO to janitor. These changes will not occur so the marketing department can promote ?green? products. It won't happen out of altruism. Nor will it occur because it is required, although all are true. Businesses will do these things simply because of the positive impact on the bottom line.

These criticisms have expanded in recent years to include those from prominent politicians, investors, consultants, and academics. If such criticisms have merit, they would imply a massive governance failure in which there has been decades of underinvestment with little adjustment on the part of managers, boards, or the market for corporate control. This article evaluates the economic underpinnings of these criticisms and analyzes their implications in the context of empirical evidence produced by several decades of research on corporate investment policies, the outcomes of corporate control events, investor horizons, and the market pricing of companies with little if any earnings. In reviewing the findings of these studies, the author finds little evidence to support the view that U.S. companies sacrifice long-run value and competitiveness by systematically underinvesting. First, although U.S. companies have indeed cut back on tangible investments such as property, plant, and equipment, these cutbacks have been more than offset by the dramatic growth in investment in intangibles, such as spending on developing knowledge capital, brand-building, and IT infrastructure. Second, when subjected to events that have the effect of reducing managerial control over investment policies and transferring control to outside investors?such as leveraged buyouts and recapitalizations, forced CEO dismissals, and shareholder activist campaigns?companies tend to reduce, not increase, investment spending. In fact, it is difficult to find any corporate control threats that have had the goal or effect of increasing investment. Third, and at the same time, the rising concentration of large institutional investors, including indexers such as BlackRock and Vanguard, suggests that investors have become, if anything, more long-term oriented over time. Fourth, there is no evidence that the market shuns companies that have yet to report large (or indeed any) earnings. These findings suggest that curbing overinvestment, and not discouraging myopia and underinvestment, may well still be the larger corporate governance challenge facing investors when monitoring and attempting to influence the performance of U.S. companies.","2019-09-01","2025-02-06 20:33:19","2025-02-06 20:33:19","2025-02-06","74-80","","3","31","","Journal of Applied Corporate Finance","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The pursuit of enlightened shareholder value is found wanting because of its difficulty of taking into account and responding to ?externalities,? the social costs and benefits of corporate actions not reflected on their own cash flows and balance sheets. Stakeholder theory, while properly recognizing an intrinsic interest in non-investor corporate constituencies, provides management with no guidance for decision-making, particularly for evaluating tradeoffs among stakeholders. Shareholder welfare advocates, like this session's discussant and his coauthor Oliver Hart, expect pension funds, sovereign wealth funds, and other ?universal investors? to succeed in influencing management to temper long-run value maximization with investment addressing social problems like the environment and inequality. The main speaker of this session, after expressing doubt about investors? ability to fulfill this responsibility, urges companies to adopt corporate purposes that go beyond value maximization in seeking ?profitable solutions to individual and social problems and without creating problems for people and the planet.? A distinguished Columbia finance professor and former president of the American Finance Association discusses the findings of his research on the market pricing of climate change risk with a well-known activist investor and corporate governance expert. After examining the stock returns of high- and low-carbon emitting public companies in 77 countries during the relatively recent period 2005-2017, Bolton reports that the realized returns of high-carbon emitting companies were significantly higher than those of their low-emitting counterparts. Such higher returns are construed as the risk premiums required by investors for bearing the ?transition risk? now faced by corporations. These premiums also represent a higher cost of capital for high-carbon emitters and, as such, reflect the market's attempt to ?price,? and thereby, limit the negative externalities associated with climate change. And as both panelists go on to point out, this premium did not exist in the 1990s, and increased notably in the wake of the 2015 Paris Agreement. In this exchange between a Nobel Prize-winning economist and the former CEO of Unilever and champion of ESG, the Nobel laureate begins by defending the Coase-Friedman value maximization approach that, he argues has largely prevailed in large corporations throughout the world. According to this view, the best prescription for social welfare are policies that encourage companies to maximize their own long-run efficiency and value. In so doing, they create the largest possible economic ?pie,? which can then be redistributed by governments as they see fit. The former CEO of Unilever, while agreeing that radical reform of capitalism is unwarranted, calls for greater urgency and larger corporate efforts to combat climate change and inequality. Noting that Lord Lever founded his company some 150 years ago to solve serious hygiene problems that contributed to infant mortality, companies must increasingly be driven by a sense of purpose that goes beyond value maximization to satisfy today's universal investors. Two distinguished academics discuss the findings of recent studies that aim to measure the effects of corporate purpose on financial performance using measures of purpose that rely on surveys of how much meaning employees say they find in their jobs. Distinguishing between high-purpose camaraderie, in which employees feel the organization is a little like a family, and purpose clarity, in which employees find a high sense of meaning in their work as well as a clear view of what they need to do, the studies that although camaraderie has no correlation with performance but purpose clarity is highly predictive of performance. And what appears to be a causal connection between purpose and performance is driven entirely by the middle ranks of the company. Employee beliefs about their firm's purpose also appear weaker in public companies than in private, and weaker in private-equity-owned, firms than among conventional private firms. Among public companies, purpose is lower for companies with significant hedge fund ownership, but higher in companies with high percentages of long-term investors. Although environmental degradation and accelerating wealth inequality are ?public good? problems, government is no longer capable of solving them alone. The private sector must play a major role, in part by pricing negative externalities into their goods and services. But if business enterprises have a strong interest in solving environmental and social problems because they are threats to economic growth, both speakers stress that economic growth is also essential to solving these problems. While agreeing that capitalism is the engine of wealth creation, and recognizing the threat its harmful side effects pose to corporate legitimacy and license to operate, both speakers see daunting challenges to solving the collective action problem and persuading companies to ?internalize? externalities. The CEO of CaixaBank holds up his organization as an example of a successful bank that operates with a stakeholder approach. CaixaBank's ability to pursue this approach reflects in large part the 40% ownership of its shares by a non-profit foundation that has been funding social work for more than 100 years. A U.K. entrepreneur and Member of Parliament discusses corporate governance challenges during the COVID pandemic with the deputy CEO of INGKA, the retail arm of IKEA, and the Chairman of Standard Chartered, the largest bank in Spain. The Chairman of Standard Chartered calls for integrating purpose into the operation of its business in five fundamental dimensions: ownership, governance, values, leadership, and financial resilience. To put ESG goals into practice, the bank uses ?Sustainable Development Goals,? or SDGs, and publishes an annual summary demonstrating its progress toward those goals. IKEA, which is owned by the INGKA foundation, professes commitment to eight values, including cost consciousness and care for people and the planet. IKEA's management measures the company's performance in four ways: value created for (1) its investors; (2) its consumers; (3) its employees and local communities; and (4) the environment.","2021-06-01","2025-02-06 20:33:19","2025-02-06 20:33:19","2025-02-06","41-94","","2","33","","Journal of Applied Corporate Finance","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
